85886816	Os invasores da Companhia DeVitt atacarão o rancho O'Hara ao anoitecer. Cooper prometeu a Kate ajudá-la a defendê-lo.
1643626384	Em um vale rochoso a oeste de Flagstone fica o Rancho O'Hara, uma fazenda considerável com vários tipos de colheitas e gado./n/nO rancho é administrado por Ian O'Hara, tio de Kate, além de vários agricultores. É o orgulho e a alegria do tio Ian, e tem sido a casa de Kate desde os nove anos de idade./n/nAgora esta casa está em perigo.

826928811	Após a morte de seu tio, Kate quer libertar sua casa da Companhia DeVitt./n/nPara impedir que mais homens cheguem a Flagstone, ela planeja explodir a ponte ferroviária em Eagle Falls./n/n Os outros concordam em ajudar.

1291349659	Um inferno de uma noite
2081499567	Depois de algumas semanas de viagem, a turma passa a noite em um salão de Baton Rouge. As costas estão descansadas e as histórias são compartilhadas sobre alimentos e bebidas. Muitas e muitas bebidas.
2064647518	Em um penhasco com vista para o Mississippi fica a pitoresca velha Baton Rouge./n/nAqui, camas confortáveis e comida quente aguardam viajantes cansados, eles chegam por terra ou por um dos muitos barcos a vapor que atracam todos os dias no porto./n/n A turma está a caminho de Nova Orleans há algumas semanas. Depois de mais um longo dia na estrada, eles chegam a Baton Rouge./n/nO ar está cheio de música, risos e cheiro de vômito.

1265907159	Com o marechal Wayne a reboque, a gangue volta para Nova Orleans enquanto o Ninho da Rainha arde atrás deles./n/nNo caminho, Cooper fica muito quieto.

327079711	Tendo escapado recentemente da mina de ouro de DeVitt, a gangue se vê agredida, machucada e com pouco moral./n/nA partida de Doc pesa sobre todos, e o fato de ele ter levado o único cavalo disponível com ele também não ajuda as coisas./n/nIndependentemente disso, eles precisam ir para a cidade mais próxima com uma estação de trem, progredindo lentamente devido à perna machucada de Cooper./n/nQuando eles chegam, eles se abrigam em uma casa em ruínas nos arredores da cidade.
166306906	Após a fuga da mina de DeVitt, Doc está farto da situação atual e decide continuar por conta própria. Os outros vão para a estação ferroviária mais próxima. Na chegada, eles encontram o lugar ocupado pelos homens do DeVitt. Além disso, parece que nenhum dos trens realmente para na estação./n/nEnquanto Isabelle cura a perna de Cooper, Kate e Hector procuram uma maneira de parar o trem./n/nO plano deles é bloquear os trilhos e depois pegar carona uma carona no próximo trem para que todos possam ir para casa.

As coisas ainda estão tensas, mas os primeiros passos foram dados./n/nDe volta à civilização, a gangue entra em contato com o marechal Wayne, que fica emocionado ao saber que eles ainda estão vivos.

861610767	A gangue escapa das garras de DeVitt e faz contato com o marechal Wayne. Juntos, eles formam um plano para tirar DeVitt e Frank de fora./n/nDeVitt é o primeiro da lista.

1603078355	Bem-vindo ao nível de teste do controle de qualidade! Neste nível de teste, você pode executar testes limpos de caracteres, NPCs utilizáveis e muito mais. Alguns recursos podem estar ausentes, mas serão adicionados em futuras iterações deste nível.
663543378	Esta é a sala de jogos. Ao entrar no nível de teste do controle de qualidade, você sempre começará aqui com todos os caracteres à frente. No topo, você encontra um pequeno parkour para teste de navegação do jogador.
574096615	A norte da sala de jogos está a lista de truques.
789341352	À direita da sala de jogos, você encontrará a sala de testes. É a sala de teste principal, com todos os guardas e com a maioria dos recursos, que serão necessários para o teste.
1091142676	No norte da sala de teste, você encontrará o painel de controle. O painel de controle funciona da seguinte maneira: Primeiro você escolhe um tipo de guarda e depois a posição em que o tipo de guarda deve ser gerado. Dessa forma, você pode gerar todos os tipos de inimigos em todos os tipos de configurações diferentes.
1135000294	Na extrema direita, encontramos o parkour. Esta sala foi projetada para testes de navegação inimiga, mas também para testes de portas. Os inimigos podem ser ativados com o painel de controle no norte desta sala. Após a ativação, eles seguirão sua rota pelo parkour.
1873777461	Se você deseja navegar rapidamente pelo nível de teste, dê uma olhada no log de dicas. Espero que este pequeno tutorial tenha respondido a todas as perguntas. Para mais perguntas, pergunte a Toby. É isso por agora: testes felizes e que Deus abençoe meu amigo! *Bob Ross quote end*

1345089562	Vamos! Abra, seu monte de merda!
52315649	Abrar! Droga, estou morrendo de sede aqui.
1708575428	Não é justo. Eu posso sentir o cheiro do uísque daqui.
1722395276	Merda. Quem perdeu a porra da chave, afinal?
799306384	Volto mais tarde com um machado.
200422027	Ainda não vai ceder. Droga.
960289221	Por que você não abre, seu pedaço de merda.
1143306891	Tem uísque lá dentro. Eu sei disso.
967692626	Por que eu tenho que ficar aqui fora?
677920504	Merda, eu realmente poderia dar um tiro agora.
444229462	Foda-se ... Essa sede está me matando.
1273054320	Quem vai passar por aqui de qualquer maneira?
678736588	O que diabos aconteceu?!
1561295358	Desculpe ... eu escorreguei.
1989147937	John!
1619913815	Johnny, não!
52069976	Deus não!
1737853021	Esse é o meu garoto. Agora fique perto.
673464788	Há outro à frente.
1939658397	Precisamos chamar a atenção dele para outro lugar.
1566035860	Certo. Vou jogar uma das minhas moedas.
971260786	Boa ideia. Faça com que ele vire a cabeça. Eu farei o resto.
1816478218	Faça com que ele vire a cabeça.
1903341140	Ele tem que desviar o olhar.
284741563	Faça-o desviar o olhar.
2142470101	Você já fez isso antes.
521173166	Ele não ouviu a moeda.
1346330984	Jogue a moeda mais perto.
1304306774	Lembre-se - pense devagar, aja rápido.
1510475130	Nós sempre escondemos o corpo.
186921039	Você está prestando atenção.
434305833	Me siga. Mantenha sua cabeça baixa.
982212394	Cristo, eu odeio cavalos. Bestas estúpidas.
80618972	"Você faz os cavalos, Sal." Ahah muito engraçado.
683117499	Está certo. Apenas fique ai e coma.
1511957846	Você! Você é o pior deles!
2065162587	Não se atreva a me chutar, entendeu?
1035198870	Diabo maldito. Estou de olho em você.
1094668953	Ele quer me chutar. Eu sei isso.
1860765847	Não Tente nada engraçado, está me ouvindo?
1347961325	Se você me chutar, eu vou dar um tiro em seu traseiro.
29525659	Eu odeio cavalos, Billy.
947759493	Deixe-me, estou aqui.
395352510	Vamos lá, vamos mudar de lugar.
1095449348	Cada um faz a sua parte, Sal.
1258460792	Por que você não pode fazer os cavalos?
1580432621	Porque é mais engraçado quando você faz isso.
140547430	Isso vai dar certo.
969963853	Ei, pai? 
2105600160	Sim?
1347077792	Quantos homens Frank tem?
1767201949	Não importa, garoto. Um a um, você sempre tem uma chance. Você só precisa diminuir o grupo. 
1708426917	Bloqueado. Nenhuma surpresa lá.
961203488	Bloqueado. Não há surpresas lá.
2121242683	Tudo bem, filho. Hora de um desafio.
1608020280	Vê aquela escada lá em cima? Eu preciso que você jogue para mim.
1217893076	Bom trabalho! Esse é o meu garoto!
669315966	Foi fácil!
1808677364	Mantenha sua cabeça baixa. Há mais deles.
1654110603	Você tem que encontrar uma maneira de se esconder.
1661663094	Você ouviu falar de Lindberg? Foi ele que engoliu a última garrafa de Old Hutch.
1165105379	Isso explica por que o velho bastardo dá tudo para ele.
1479050419	O que você acha que ele fará? Chamá-lo para sair... para um duelo?
683057496	Você conhece o velho Hutch... O único amigo dele é a garrafa dele.
679665959	Meu dinheiro estaria em Hutch. Ele é tão mau quanto eles vêm. Rápido também.
2061201113	sim! E ele também está bêbado como um gambá. E ele tem esses shakes.
2010416411	Cinco dólares por Hutch! O que me diz?
710375432	É uma aposta. Uma peça desagradável de Lindberg para o trabalho.
1586398938	Lindberg! Saia, seu ladrão de uísque!
1872026001	Estou bem aqui, seu bêbado until. Vamos resolver isso.
1298793123	Você ouviu isso? Está prestes a cair! Vamos!
1577121988	Está na hora de você pagar por roubar o que é meu por direito!
208492544	Você não me assusta, seu imbecil!
113944635	Aquela garrafa era a MINHA garrafa!
1288348702	Você vai me matar com seu hálito horrível.
1500668642	Ha! Muito devagar, sua vadia ladra. Tem o que você mereceu.
58060641	Sim .. Leve isso para o seu túmulo, seu bêbado inutel.
1278130353	Olhos à frente, garoto! Esse duelo não nos diz respeito.
1500641619	Vê aquele ali no fundo, perto do penhasco?
867275810	Encontre uma maneira de distraí-lo com sua moeda, para que eu possa pega-los.
173700865	O outro, John.
788470849	Ele ainda está respirando. Amarre-o rapidamente e antes que ele acorde.
610402371	Cuidado!
1693227310	Desculpe.
270329634	Não é um dia para perder a cabeça, filho. Apenas vá e esconda o corpo.
6254567	Bom trabalho. Agora esconda-os nos arbustos.
814465367	Aí garoto. Vamos lá.
1249224831	Temos que nos mexer.
2009387216	Você vem filho?
1269776983	O que você está esperando?
436041377	De onde eles vieram?
768305125	Não importa. Vê aquele guindaste lá em cima?
199740460	Sim.
1397304671	Que tal você ir até lá e fazer uma entrega.
369857519	Chegando logo, senhor.
616012734	Eu fiz isso!
1056472202	Bom trabalho, filho. Agora fique aí. Eu irei até você.
1632996207	Bom trabalho, garoto.
1189061753	Você sabe o que fazer. Você espera até eu voltar.
1717160180	Pensei que estava pronto desta vez.
1181643869	Da próxima vez, quem sabe.
1437875326	Você disse a mesma coisa da última vez. Por que não posso ir com você? Apenas me dê uma arma!
352432993	Uma arma, hein?
503611392	Eu quero ver você espetar naquela árvore a quinze passos.
205456903	Eu quero ver você espetar naquela árvore a dez passos.
1632727931	Quando você fizer isso, estará pronto para uma arma.

67595800	Nós vamos deixar tudo muito limpo.
226511189	Como os meninos gostam de saquear.
561111430	É uma pena que eu tenha que ficar de guarda aqui.
1256294145	Como se alguém passasse por aqui.
1198044642	Ordens do caralho.
2056535846	Vamos atravessar.
1294728632	Há uma vigia, no penhasco.
1530678151	Vou levá-lo daqui.
1457731169	Que eu quero ver.
2021481338	Não sei para onde foi, mas não era seu alvo.
1212423052	Você não impressionou até agora, Sr. McCoy.
1122724759	Vamos lá, McCoy. Não temos o dia todo.
251747283	Bem, eu vou ser amaldiçoado.
1669130534	Rifle de longo alcance. Estoque personalizado, rodadas personalizadas.
1272865861	Espero que não se importe, Sr. McCoy.
1105231492	Bem. Eu salvo uma bala.
1236950567	Vamos la.
520419993	Meus dias de escalada estão atras de mim, Sr. Cooper.
1671694831	Bem, vamos descobrir algo.
1511114845	Eu ainda estou esperando aqui, Sr. Cooper!
1661976841	É melhor levantá-lo antes de seguir em frente!
486887981	Espero que você possa escalar essa escada de corda, Sr. McCoy.
1030677372	Eu prefiro o doutor McCoy.
916815113	Tenho certeza que sim.
758812215	Fique de olho. O amigo dele vai procurá-lo.
2027247329	Cuidado. O amigo dele vai descobrir que ele não está no posto dele.
425004179	O que há com aquele cara de poncho?
1659968206	Vê aquele com o poncho?
906565404	Ele não vai se mexer se não for necessário.
1155934742	E você sabe disso porque...
2126919349	Confie em mim. Eu sei o tipo.
1317692460	Nada ainda. Por que está demorando tanto?
1680411418	O bastardo provavelmente está escondido em algum lugar. Não se preocupe, eles o encontrarão.
1699565207	Eles não deveriam estar de volta agora?
268746474	Não, eu aposto que eles estão demorando com ele. O bastardo merece isso.
143066108	E se ele os matou...Talvez eu seja o próximo.
1916520478	Heh, relaxa. Um cara como ele não vai desperdiçar uma bala em você.
1529165791	Adoro quando um plano funciona.
863068086	Sim, O Grande Ann sabe o que está fazendo.
2048397418	Ela com certeza faz.
1004650523	Quanto tempo você acha que temos?
533505294	Ninguém escapou, então podemos levar o nosso tempo.
565392077	Heh, legal.
1891347620	Algo está incomodando você?
1435572714	Sim, você me diz o que a merda de um barco está fazendo aqui?
817174129	Não sei, não me importo.
56340574	Vamos fazer isso quieto. Eu pego um, você pega o outro.
1076432959	Vamos lá, eu sei que ele conseguiu.
1432156816	Procurá-lo muito bem, você ouviu?
1322432559	Você está demorando ou o quê?
1410962525	Precisamos dessa chave para o cofre.
1085771153	Eu posso sentir o cheiro. Aquele, doce, doce dinheiro.
1638431021	Está certo. Mantenha a cabeça baixa, ou eu vou explodi-lo..
1540093329	Hah, e você pensou que poderia revidar. Agora olhe para você!
2143608143	É melhor você nos dar tudo ou vamos procurar seus corpos mais tarde.
1812276984	Você vai conhecer Big Ann em breve. Você não está animado?
155411799	Golly, eu odeio gente chique como você. Especialmente você.
55708919	É isso que você ganha ao andar no trem da Comapanhia DeVitt.
1876589766	Prefiro ficar de fora disso.
782751206	Os passageiros certamente poderiam usar nossa ajuda.
271645073	Por que perder tempo? Vamos continuar. 
1374310770	Vai? Sem perder tempo.
131212092	Você é um bastardo frio, Sr. McCoy.
357527990	Cada um na sua, Sr. Cooper.
766710338	Seja você quem for, obrigado.
75578718	Nada disso. Agora fique parado.
688884155	Eu te mando o cheque.
1658760377	Isso foi uma perda de tempo.
628972340	Vê isso? Eu sabia que ele tinha seu pequeno coração.
1808600642	Anatomicamente, talvez.
179315794	Aí está a locomotiva.
31474280	Frente do trem. Parece que conseguimos.
1036869811	Ainda precisamos da dinamite para limpar o túnel.
143433601	Isso é fácil. Vamos subir.
1962487386	Aquela pedra grande parece que quer cair.
1047035443	Espada de Dâmocles. Que a rocha está implorando para ser empurrada.
1665137781	Ei, sem ossos. Você vai deixar as caixas se acumularem aqui embaixo?
852574330	Se apresse. Precisamos seguir em frente.
1951044472	Certifique-se de que essas pessoas não saiam daqui.
841434891	Eles tentarão de tudo, atiram neles!
2055157191	Você verme da empresa. Diga-me onde estão os cofres.
1159849560	Eu-eu-eu não sei, senhorita. Eu juro.
1782893817	Eu sei que a compãnia DeVitt tem esse dinheiro neste trem. Cadê?
1514072165	Como eu iria saber? Eles não me dizem nada.
993876529	Não adianta esconder isso de mim, querido. Meus homens vão encontrar.
1144006518	Não estou escondendo nada, senhorita.
1116280026	Os cofres. Qual vagão? Diga-me ou eu vou atirar em você na cara.
382088829	Eu não tenho a menor idéia do que você está falando.
33456719	Estou perdendo minha paciência.
667736715	Por favor! Não!
439455722	Inútil...
300333351	Encontre aqueles malditos cofres, seus imbecis!
857711144	O dinheiro está nesse trem! Então é melhor você encontrá-lo!
762266956	Apresse-se, seus idiotas, antes que os oficiais descubram!
1660905154	Quem vê primeiro os cofres recebe um grande bônus!
925116337	Se você não descarregar esse trem mais rápido, é o último que você verá!
117746040	Vamos lá, merda! Quero tudo carregado em uma hora.
242250607	Mantenha a cabeça baixa e fique fora do meu caminho.
2140777347	Mantenha a cabeça baixa. Nós cuidaremos dos bandidos.
1638609231	Obrigado, muito obrigado!
1589117487	Eu acendi o fusível. Melhor jogá-lo rápido.
1643089788	Eu acendi o fusível. Melhor jogá-lo rápido.
1568822276	Que diabos?! Pegue-os, seus malditos idiotas inúteis!
434476931	Que diabos?! Pegue-os, seus malditos idiotas inúteis!
132910932	Ainda bem que temos mais dinamite.
981381405	Ainda bem que temos mais dinamite.
1975216237	Acho que é o suficiente. Vamos encontrar um local seguro para nos encontrarmos.
1141150704	Tudo certo. Vamos encontrar um local seguro para nos encontrarmos.
2003325372	Por mim tudo bem.
1576105220	Hmm... parece um piquenique. Nada mais. Eu deveria voltar para o trem.
990742861	Alguém fez um pequeno piquenique aqui! É isso aí, no entanto. É melhor eu voltar.
84273769	Pensando bem, por que não fazemos uma pausa.
1698751564	E agora? E o trem?
619299078	Tudo a seu tempo, Sr. Cooper. Agora, por que você não tenta isso?
1840322319	Um cupcake? Está falando sério?
2006229049	Minha receita mais recente. Estou procurando... voluntários para experimentar.
618195600	Uh huh. Quantos voluntários sobreviveram a esta receita sua?
1843640598	É nova, Sr. Cooper. Você é o primeiro.
1956162352	Bem, não se ofenda, mas acho que prefiro minhas porções.
268397488	Como quiser.
1808341550	Hum... Banho de creme de manteiga triplo. Um toque de macadâmia e anis. Coberto com um recheio de geléia de morango perfeitamente equilibrado.
1498412873	Puxa, uma especialista no assunto. Ok, me dê um.
1366813644	Receio que esta tenha sido minha única amostra. Você teve sua chance.
1392707135	Hrm...
1092787853	Agora, de volta à tarefa em questão.
766046273	Certo. Qualquer coisa que você diga.
366179940	Tudo certo. Vamos lidar com o resto deles.
817921335	Meus pensamentos exatamente.
1836596718	Acho que você fez a compãnia DeVitt feliz hoje.
793788117	Quanto você ganha por um emprego como este?
851137006	Espero que você não esteja esperando um corte.
1837965531	Relaxa. Eu tenho o que eu preciso.
491675002	Você está mudando de carona?
1841729439	Preciso ser pontual. Como eu disse...
724091013	...Eu tenho um compromisso que eu gostaria de manter.
1683520205	Adapte-se.
1183665302	Não foi tão ruim trabalhar com você, McCoy.
1137118737	Certo. Se você precisa de um profissional, sabe a quem pedir.
869904866	Bom dia, Sr. Cooper.
1296821262	VO TRACK
1076983379	Avance ao longo do trem
447712959	Bandidos estão vigiando o trem. Vá para a frente.
2094535640	Obtenha uma Dynamite
362613368	Pegue um pedaço de dinamite do barril no platô.
1139826278	Limpe o túnel
308496222	Os bandidos bloquearam o túnel. Use a dinamite para limpá-lo.
1613884632	Encontre-se no ponto de encontro
1487124933	Leve Cooper e McCoy para o local da reunião para que eles possam terminar o trabalho.
661094834	Pedra solta
1717845166	Esta rocha parece solta. Uma pena se isso caísse sobre alguém.
220005127	Eles derrubaram a casa do velho William outro dia.
327290212	Era necessário? Eles não podem colocar os trilhos entre nossas casas?
468907971	Atenha-se ao jogo, sim?
434325556	Só estou dizendo que, se eles vierem a minha casa, mostrarei a esses bandidos da ferrovia quem é o chefe.
1240800355	Merda...
873549268	O que posso fazer por vocês, senhores?
492613005	Oh, chegamos a você em um minuto.
344462297	Você sabe o que fazer! Todo mundo fora!
483700298	Sim, Senhor!
1996050564	Olhe como eles correrem!
1927673309	Tem algo em seus ouvidos?
1784449216	Apenas terminando minha bebida.
2055948310	Ouça idiota, agora a cidade é nossa. Então, quando ele diz, é melhor você...
442865048	Não gostamos de encrenqueiros por aqui.
437383994	Ha! Quem nós temos aqui ?!
941942434	Bem, você tem problemas em dobro agora.
2023323252	Hector! Uma pequena ajuda aqui?
1330553353	Que diabos?! Você novamente?!
739784153	Hahaa! Eles estão fugindo como cães!
1095568786	Eu não os culpo. Os pobres tiveram que olhar para o seu rosto feio.
1282782173	Ah, de nada! Você precisa de uma bebida. Eu também.
521211476	Hector, você esta em casa.
892411820	Gracias, senorita. Se eles voltarem, me ligue.
1488340076	Heh, obrigada. Se eles voltarem, você só me liga.
462607319	Você realmente não deveria. Eles vão te matar da próxima vez.
1261667122	Eles podem tentar.
1646631313	Acho que você está aqui há um tempo - gastou seu tempo irritando as pessoas erradas, hein?
1439920483	Eu sou o que eles irritaram. Mas como você está aqui, talvez possamos trabalhar juntos.
1968501055	Oh não, você não está me arrastando para isso. Estou aqui pelo Frank.
418117848	Cercar o lugar! Não os deixe fugir!
556288454	Amigo, você já está nisso. E além disso, você me deve uma.
1217092235	Tudo bem, vamos sair daqui.
265115482	Vamos lá para fora!
1753812082	VO TRACK
718420870	Rápido, por aqui!
282643245	Eles estão aqui em algum lugar, e temos todo tempo do mundo.
1164791611	Esses caras vão matá-lo. Quem diabos são eles?
625254008	Parte da compãnia DeVitt. Eu tenho contas para resolver com alguns deles.
1298661064	Tudo bem, tudo bem! Mas espero que você tenha um plano.
1710621721	Uh, claro!
1710522083	Vamos para a rua. Ninguém nos incomodará se ficarmos entre os habitantes da cidade, com isso teremos espaço para respirar.
1090916079	Por enquanto, tudo bem. Mas quem nós temos que "carregar"?
743641397	Jarvis é o primeiro. Um cara bastante duro. Agora ele está naquele quintal tentando montar o touro na cidade.
465329894	Depois, há Wild Marge. Ele está no primeiro andar do bordel de Flagstone, bebendo uísque e assistindo as garotas dançarem.
174165267	Depois, há "o duque". Rodando com seus capangas, indo e vindo pelas ruas da igreja.
1314266132	E o último é o capataz, McBane. Ele é um verdadeiro idiota. Seus homens derrubaram metade da cidade para que ele não precisassem se desviar. 
1883399229	Então nos livramos deles, voltamos para a taberna e terminamos nossas bebidas.
354756553	Como plano, é uma loucura, Hector.
1477743624	Por que você acha que eu esperei por você?
1977264724	Tudo certo. Vamos acabar logo com isso.
1859777443	Tem certeza de que eles estão aqui, Murdock?
655992159	Eles não poderiam ter escapado.
50795188	O que acontece quando eles aparecem?
535869234	Nós atiramos neles e depois vamos a taberna.
969948446	Inferno, estou ficando com sede, Murdock.
964505631	Eles não podem se esconder para sempre, Sam. Agora junte suas coisas. 
1606933793	Eu digo que é hora de usar Bianca.
1381111512	Você ainda está carregando essa coisa?
961267106	Eu tenho uma reputação para manter.
1164823537	Tudo bem, minha beleza. Vamos atrair alguém para o seu abraço.
2073897713	Odiaria ser esse cara.
139277608	Entende? Aquela garota nunca me decepciona.
967180754	Boa jogada. Eu sabia que estava certo em trazê-lo junto.
936538598	Claro que estou feliz por atender às suas expectativas.
1487837025	Você terminou de se exibir?
1398203994	Alguém precisa fazer as coisas por aqui.
641296365	Acho que ouvi alguns ossos rangerem.
840216268	Você deseja amigo! Estou tão em forma como se tivesse vinte anos!
1872296638	Lembre-se, deixe o grandalhão comigo. Ele já te pegou uma vez.
1981178347	Ele é todo seu.
568409435	Deveria ter me deixado terminar minha bebida.
1932523298	Hah! Não é seu dia de sorte, não é?
1028846366	Essa é uma. Para a próxima. Você está se divertindo ainda?
210201627	Um monte.
1920493164	Um a menos, restam três. Você me colocou em toda bagunça...
1025778135	Passamos por coisas piores.
1768942864	Nós estamos fora. relaxar.
450923163	Não há necessidade de se esconder agora.
1511639709	Então, quem é o próximo na sua lista?
429389325	Então, quem é o primeiro da sua lista?
99315968	Que tal matá-los na ordem que gostamos.
1852126838	Ótimo plano que você tem lá.
385726871	guardas demais para um quintal.
2129972192	Jarvis e seus homens estão por aqui. Certamente ele estará com o touro novamente.
1962085150	Então é melhor manter a cabeça baixa quando estivermos dentro
1251247827	Hah! Ele realmente acha que pode montar esse touro!
1012726449	Então vocês dois brigaram e agora ele quer você morto?
868584661	Parece que Jarvis está mechendo com esse touro o dia todo.
444350566	Você sabe como é. Alguns caras simplesmente não podem deixar as coisas descansarem. Como aquela vez em El Paso.
864913954	Heh, se esse touro ficar bravo, nós vamos fazer um show. Como aquela vez em El Paso.
1863617101	Mais como sempre em El Paso.
392132413	Você mostra aquele touro que é o chefe, chefe!
954104016	Oh, eu vou quebrar esse filho da puta, só espere.
1743065594	Não deixe que ele te pegue, chefe!
484357500	Estou apenas me aquecendo, ok ?! Da próxima vez será minha, com certeza.
2119554904	Aquele touro não tem nada para fazer, chefe.
135762165	Você está certo sobre isso. Eu sou o melhor!
1296674087	Parece que Jarvis não era um figurão, afinal.
1934746503	Isso cuida de Jarvis. Eu disse a ele que ele deveria descansar.
1399763221	Tudo bem, faltam dois.
653569855	Esse é o número dois. Diga-me que você não gosta disso.
247807550	Bem, pelo menos estamos no meio do caminho.
926318647	Parece que o local está fechado.
968863431	O prostíbulo. Os habitantes da cidade não podem entrar desde que Wild Marge assumiu.
1016228655	Não é a porta da frente então. Tudo bem, mantenha-o baixo. Vamos encontrar outra maneira de entrar.
773411105	Aqui embaixo.
171969419	Ei, Cooper. Aqui embaixo.
1804048600	Podemos entrar no bordel daqui. Melhor ficar abaixado.
907428322	Olha este prostíbulo. Maior edifício da cidade.
687956115	Este lugar me lembra aquele em Deadwood.
660765928	Há muitos prostíbulos em Deadwood.
304923026	Você sabe, aquele onde eles me expulsaram.
1197440159	Isso não ajuda.
785732256	Tudo bem, estamos dentro. Lugar legal.
1122523221	Será difícil chegar a Marge. Ela está no último andar.
456580536	Sempre tem um jeito.
646414453	Menina! Mais uísque!
1685343001	Eu vou buscá-lo.
287534887	Mais uísque! Vá em frente!
1492091083	Sim, senhora!
726987380	Pare com isso. Vá buscar o uísque.
1120377451	O-claro. Me desculpe. Eu vou buscá-lo.
687649935	O que você quer?
1652250045	O que você acha? Uísque para a dama.
449459114	Tudo certo. Suba as escadas.
978446912	Enuncie seu negocio.
1332490340	Mesmo? Ela quer mais uísque.
118126660	Bem. Você pode subir.
2042492765	Seu uísque, senhora.
1886486558	Foda-se, pode também...
993296811	Ahh... coisas boas.
1640929120	Hum... só um gole.
1147999977	Mhh... oh sim.
472276261	Hmm... talvez possamos colocar alguma coisa no uísque?
1938203517	Ei amigo. Acha que poderíamos fazer algo com o uísque?
40499276	Heh, eu poderia colocar meu uísque lá.
1989642541	Precisamos de coisas mais fortes se quisermos matá-la.
1690003240	Aqui está uma garrafa de...
1357892389	Ei amigo. O que diz nesta garrafa?
1726962301	Láudano! Tome muito disso e é tão bom quanto veneno. Vamos pegar.
533733250	Bah! Se você diz.
518116007	Felicidades.
785736607	Vergonha pelo uísque.
1823097407	Eu não sei amigo. Você mata um homem, olha nos olhos dele.
1681482582	Como quando você usa sua armadilha gigante de urso?
1806652712	Ei, deixe Bianca fora disso!
1586455645	O que ... Algo de...
964256332	H-ei! O que está errado? Socorro!
408677718	Que diabos!
1892649360	Merda! Ela está morta! Talvez fosse o uísque...
1721722381	Eu tenho que avisar os outros!
433108508	Até mais, Wild Marge.
772149685	É isso para Marge.
711013061	São três a menos.
243224828	Com isso são três. 
1462366558	Como é que você luta com todos os imbecis da cidade?
957382233	Talvez eu não consiga suportar os idiotas bundões.
400273429	O que está acontecendo lá?
579796830	É aqui que eles estão colocando os trilhos. McBane é o capataz e não deixa ninguém no local.
1604301042	Então vamos ficar calados quando entrarmos.
1458208472	Por isso, o trem teve que parar fora da cidade.
1550994567	Você pensava que a ferrovia seria boa para as pessoas daqui. Mas metade do local foi destruido. Quem ordenou isso quer que essas pessoas saiam.
1441992625	Você quer dizer Vincent DeVitt, o chefe da ferrovia.
2083311056	Se você diz. Homens como ele são a razão pela qual tudo vai cagar.
308963957	Claro, porque ele tem homens como nós que fazem seu trabalho sujo. 
253997050	Você está matando o clima, amigo.
1327133639	Oh merda, precisamos de alguns trabalhadores de verdade, porra.
290619400	Aqueles idiotas. Nós nunca terminaremos a tempo.
1290020865	O que eu faço? DeVitt não vai gostar disso.
635295399	Você acha isso engraçado ?! Olhe para esta parede! Totalmente errado! 
493464044	Qual de vocês imbecis construiu isso? DeVitt ficará furioso!
790174616	Você olhou para os planos? Quem fez isso, você está demitido!
494269375	A mudança acabou, McBane.
457395387	O xerife não está aqui desta vez, McBane.
1246625244	É isso aí. Tudo feito.
229843799	Lá se vai o último.
180798282	Satisfeito agora? Você será capaz de dormir à noite?
1309747097	Estou bem, Cooper. Vamos voltar para a taberna. Nossas bebidas ainda estão esperando.
533890864	Cavalheiros!
1478476489	Guardei uísque para você.
720073865	Gracias, senorita! Não se preocupe mais com esses homens. Nós cuidaremos deles.
510662556	Heh, obrigada! Não se preocupe mais com esses homens. Nós cuidaremos deles.
34839288	Oh, isso é gentil da sua parte, Hector. Com certeza poderíamos usar um pouco mais de calma por aqui.
332701184	Bem, pessoal, eu tenho que sair. Você se importaria de ficar de olho no lugar?
1030933173	Deixe isso conosco!
610893039	Sirva-se. Volto em seguida.
1485738270	Então, há quanto tempo você está aqui?
1946867206	Alguns dias. Porque perguntas?
77927463	Você o encontrou? Você sabe onde ele está?
571840546	Você tem que trazer isso à tona agora?
963763010	Que diabos, Hector?
617268813	Vai cara. Nós apenas nos divertimos, então por que estragar tudo, hein?
1148053107	Ei, olha, eu não estou aqui para jogar o bom samaritano. Nós dois sabemos que ele está trabalhando para DeVitt. Então, apenas me diga onde ele está.
303088882	Calma, amigo... A última vez que ouvi ele estava na casa do prefeito. É apenas uma curta viagem até a montanha.
177756232	Não há razão para perder mais tempo então.
1480880844	Tem certeza de que é uma boa ideia? Está ficando tarde.
1468771553	Eu adiei isso por tempo suficiente.
1143410397	Que diferença faz mais um dia? Eu conheço Frank, e ele ainda estará lá amanhã.
1612691898	...Tudo certo. Amanhã então.
288677953	Está certo, amigo. Agora, me diga o que você tem feito.
2129741644	VO TRACK
444461650	Nós nos reunimos aqui porque nosso bom amigo Bill faleceu, esmagado por um muro que algum idiota não ergueu corretamente.
409318720	Não fui eu!
878016439	Cale a boca, Josh.
929043127	Estamos aqui para devolver seus restos esmagados à terra, cinzas em cinzas, pó em pó e todas essas coisas.
1508246087	Caras, isso é tudo que consigo me lembrar. Algum de vocês quer dizer alguma coisa?
903238742	Sim, eu tenho uma coisa. Bill ... era um bom homem. Nunca machucou uma mosca, mas batia na esposa como se não houvesse amanhã, mas quem não, não é? Descanse em paz, Bill.
1293668422	Vou sentir falta do Bill. Ele era capaz, sim, ele era. Ninguém poderia erguer um muro tão rápido e direto quanto Billy. Especialmente Josh, como todos sabemos agora.
34616657	Eu disse, não fui eu!
1617731165	E eu disse cala a maldita boca.
955829136	Sim, sim, tanto faz. Acho que todos já falamos o bastante. Vocês dois, comecem a trabalhar com pá. Eu acho que preciso de uma bebida.
1152530045	Isso é ultrajante! Você não pode simplesmente derrubar minha casa!
241605746	Ordens da companhia. A ferrovia tem que passar por aqui.
1069749397	Para o inferno com sua companhia!
2061009579	Ela está me deixando louco. Parte de mim só quer fazer as malas e sair.
1612044536	Eu fui até a gaveta dela ontem. Você sabia que ela mantém láudano lá?
1055833194	Não me diga que você gosta dessas coisas!
247554796	Ah, claro que não! Eu só me perguntei de quem tiramos isso.
1839984841	Você conhece Doc Harold? Às vezes, quando ele não pode pagar, ele traz uma garrafa de seu estoque.
848744463	Não! Sério?
734518430	Merda, olhe para essas paredes. Josh é como uma raposa meio fodida em um incêndio na floresta - ele não podia martelar duas tábuas para salvar sua vida.
958228402	Sim. Você apenas olha para eles e eles caem. Foi isso que levou Bill no outro dia.
118267129	Merda, isso vem acontecendo o dia todo.
123783945	Eu diria que ele vai atormentar o pobre animal até a morte, a menos que ele seja pisado primeiro.
1120349955	Aquele tolo idiota é como uma caixa de dinamite.
235694989	Lembra quando a pegamos do seu primo e meu garoto jogou pedras nele? Dia ruim pra caralho ...
1915388645	Eu pensei que tudo isso seria bom para a cidade.
1736913974	Ficamos muito felizes quando o prefeito nos disse que a ferrovia chegaria. E agora...
1438218330	É o cara que dirige a companhia. Sim, ele quer nos ver embora. Não dá a mínima para nós.
1235977052	Sim, e você ouviu o que eles fizeram com o velho William?
6558978 	Ultimamente estou ouvindo todo tipo de coisa. E você?
1794071182	Você sabe que o prefeito Higgins vai se casar com Miss Kate amanhã.
301471330	Sim, aquela pobre garota. O homem é um porco.
886425050	Aposto que ela está atrás do dinheiro dele.
1677873621	Não diga isso!
80192741	Você pensaria que ele teria mais cuidado com esse tipo de dinheiro.
1135368470	Eu lhe digo, o prefeito Higgins está gastando uma fortuna em seu casamento. Quase comprou minha loja inteira.
656289935	Ele está atrás de Kate há anos. Provavelmente tinha tudo planejado, caso ela finalmente dissesse que sim.
303879504	Hah! Assim como com Suzanne! Lembra quando aquele garimpeiro tentou se casar com ela?
1294148656	Sim, claro, mas eu não sei como tudo isso vai acontecer.
251907330	Sim. Você conhece aquele homem que veio com os trabalhadores. Ele está na prefeitura agora, certo?
611456286	Oh, agora que alguém tem olhos como se não houvesse vida neles. Olhou diretamente para mim quando ele passou. Eu quase me cago.
1284719727	Amaldiçoe o prefeito que ele trouxe essas pessoas aqui.
2065455987	Você acertou! Sim. E a Betty? É verdade que ela ficou doente?
2051936206	Mas eles nunca disseram a ninguém que o destruíram. Essas pessoas pobres.
1459256018	Você me pergunta, a ferrovia é uma coisa boa.
1540856498	Eles querem que todos nós sejamos, Earl. Você não pode ver isso?
1125952649	Essas ferrovias passam pela minha loja. Na minha opinião, isso é realmente bom para os negócios.
260168679	Oh, você deveria ter vergonha de si mesmo.
2139771842	Você ouviu o que aconteceu com o sino da igreja outro dia?
171777025	Sim. Imagine se ele caísse no domingo, com metade da cidade embaixo.
682214325	Eu nem quero pensar nisso ...
1656128365	Veja ... estamos construindo algo apropriado nesta represa. É assim que se faz.
1400404384	Sim exatamente, senhor.
1286619312	Você está absolutamente certo, senhor.
531548043	Dê uma boa olhada. Em alguns meses, este lugar será civilizado.
1124638527	Felizmente, senhor!
852984072	Mal posso esperar, senhor!
399513694	Ha ... uma igreja em um lugar esquecido por Deus como este. Muito icônico.
169776797	Uh ... Senhor, acho que você quer dizer ...
322456581	Cale a boca Jeremiah! Ele vai te matar.
1355221049	Ah, um cliente. *laughs*
1932236038	Deixe-me medir você. *laughs*
122688935	Dor de cabeça hein? Tome um pouco de uísque.
210796653	Dores no peito? Tome um pouco de uísque.
1361162606	Foi baleado? Eu sei exatamente a coisa-tome um pouco de uísque.
1550926584	Problemas de mulher? Tome um pouco de uísque.
182259747	Sente-se insignificante em comparação com o vasto vazio que é o nosso universo em constante expansão? Tome um pouco de uísque.
1744955242	Falta de uísque? Que pena.
283509717	Oh, ei bonitão.
2136886490	Ainda aqui, bonitão?
68530541	Bem-vindo ao Flagstone, cowboy.
1658486925	Bem, ei, cowboy.
1185929498	Você é um pistoleiro?
269530303	Bem-vindo a Flagstone, grandão.
719554718	Umm o-oi.
127549407	Ei, cara grande.
929547097	Ei cowboy.
1844286634	Pistoleiro, eh?
160532248	Oh, Olá!
368800716	Ei grandão.
967592717	Oh, haha.
1497368542	Você é enorme.
1869276301	Siga em frente.
1467788421	O que você está olhando?
807605220	O quê?
1321739430	O-o que você quer?
208098876	S-siga em frente senhor.
1316482225	O quê?
613580046	Siga em frente.
2385115	O que você está olhando?
1774966609	Que porra é essa?
670040870	Que diabos você quer?
1861377146	Avance agora.
1910319475	Que porra é essa?
66447633	Acho que você conseguiu.
239742081	Estou apenas navegando.
1454583597	Vejo você mais tarde... ou não.
1549815304	Com licença?
1861490142	Nós temos negócios?
593728846	Eu estou tentando ouvir.
904743217	Mate 4 bandidos da compãnia DeVitt
912253181	Hector tem uma lista de pessoas que ele quer ver mortos. Livre-se deles como quiser.
1842506151	Jarvis
874828944	Jarvis está tentando montar o touro nos estábulos. 
1933258732	McBane
714422562	McBane é o capataz no canteiro de obras.
1691779768	Wild Marge
1513187451	Wild Marge fica no bordel no andar superior.
1881451099	O duque
677991508	O duque está patrulhando as ruas com seus capangas.
919104746	Voltar a taberna
1033282544	Seu trabalho aqui está feito. Bebidas estão esperando por você na taberna.
795688174	Láudano
2027941112	Uma garrafa de láudano no bordel. Muito letal em altas doses.
1277718823	Boi
816766480	A raiva do boi será muito prejudicial para quem estiver por perto.
1235638969	Parede instável
232533797	Um trabalhador não tão talentoso ergueu esse muro. Só é mantido no lugar por um pedaço de corda.
115814410	Sinal instável
1101779295	Um trabalhador não tão talentoso construiu esse letreiro. Só é mantido no lugar por um pedaço fino de madeira.
902105076	Uísque
183908969	Wild Marge bebe muito uísque. A donzela traz para ele deste barril.
541866882	Sino
832290859	O sino da igreja caiu recentemente. Seria uma pena se isso acontecesse novamente.
1017964628	Ah, laje. Um lugar como muitos outros. A vida fica quieta aqui até que problemas surjam. Hoje não será um dia calmo.
1031286426	O homem que você vê aqui é Chester Goodwill: um homem de pouco valor e uma vítima perfeita para o nosso desafio hoje.
522016773	Meus clientes querem que você remova o Sr. Goodwill e entregue seu corpo à igreja. Pena que metade da cidade o esteja observando agora.
869608647	Talvez uma visita ao bordel de Flagstone estivesse em ordem. Tenho certeza de que a senhorita O'Hara apreciaria as opções extras.
447558083	Seja qual for a sua abordagem, você pode ter certeza: meus clientes estarão assistindo.
515758989	Excelente. Tenho certeza que o Sr. Goodwill apreciaria o sentimento. Assim como meus clientes apreciam seu desempenho.
267284509	Mate Chester Goodwill
178223830	Retire o vendedor vendendo suas mercadorias no meio da rua.
1901558278	Enterrar o corpo
196637280	Arraste o corpo do Sr. Goodwill para o cemitério e jogue-o no caixão.
1473554651	Disfarce
202354555	Kate pode se disfarçar de uma prostituta no bordel de Flagstone.
979423799	Todo mundo fica parado, por favor.
1359697944	Magnífico!
1559499210	E outro.
389220884	Eu acho que esse lado é muito mais imponente.
256272098	Certo, vou buscar outro prato.
2031706714	Como você gosta do vestido novo, docinho?
21845656	É adorável, querida.
986374359	Excelente! Quero que todos falem sobre esse dia nos próximos anos.
1065468858	Prefeito Higgins!
687118702	E agora?
1301008775	Frank diz que está ficando impaciente.
1758863038	Merda! Agora não! Você não vê que estamos no meio de alguma coisa?
1308103675	Me desculpe, docinho. Isso é algo que eu realmente tenho que cuidar.
1296826008	Não se preocupe comigo, querida.
952763125	Fique aqui. Volto em um instante.
2110419620	Eu preciso de mais tempo. Tente distrair Frank. Eu realmente preciso verificar os arranjos de flores.
1015183357	Sim senhor.
1297511042	VO TRACK
855950524	Finally. I thought he'd never leave.
820816475	Need to work fast. Get what I need and leave before I get dragged to the altar.
98129895	First I need a key to the upper floor.
1561478639	I think she carries a spare. Bet she won't mind if I borrow it for a spell.
533676105	The guards won't bother me so long as I don't misbehave too much.
452495515	As soon as I get it, I'll sneak in through the library door.
877447584	The upper floor is off limits. I'll have to avoid the guards until I reach the office. 
332350569	I'll turn the place upside-down until I find what I'm here for.
898990293	The rest is simple: Pular down the front balcony, steal a horse and make a break for it.
1371716073	All right then. I need to get out of here before the groom decides to check in on his bride.
1322652543	I really should turn around and get that key.
1028129373	I have to give him one thing—the dress is beautiful.
2133829287	Hmm...I doubt I could climb that.
1400608010	Oh, it's gonna be wonderful! He's been waitin' so long for her to grow up.
100557936	I wish I was married to him. That deal with the DeVitt Company made him rich.
1064942264	Well, we can't all be as lucky as Miss O'Hara.
1759505699	Are you jealous or envious?
2143813775	Jesus, that dog hates me. The feeling's mutual.
1464230705	Nice day for a wedding, ain't it?
2051394225	You look lovely, my dear.
747427895	I'm so happy for you, darling.
1490118977	I don't envy you. The mayor's got a temper.
726029901	Don't worry, miss. We'll be done in time.
482674795	Bet your uncle's proud of you.
683819174	Look at that gorgeous bride!
1433587847	Funny how things turn out, eh Katey?
2120325	You looking for something, miss?
97955316	Shouldn't you be in the dining area?
1523934878	Big day for you, huh?
1028481519	Heh heh, what can I do for you?
388369691	Climbing a ladder in a dress? I double dare you, Kate.
534769664	Hmm...a little more like this... Yes...beautiful.
1663330515	Ahhh... She really is something.
581988918	Ahhh, this isn't quite right, is it? There we go.
8707816	How graceful she is... I wish this was our wedding.
326374384	You seem a little crooked. Just let me... There! Perfect!
1509212435	One day I will muster the courage... One day I will.
1328032688	Just a little more... Yes... Very nice.
1632605479	Hello Mary. I like your walk... No...no that doesn't sound right.
798447257	Ha, well you look a little uneven there, don't you? Ahhh much better.
1340264399	Mary... Estou observando você há muito tempo... Oh, Deus, não, isso soa assustador.
1034885475	Apenas alguns pequenos toques... Sim... Isso é o que o prefeito Higgins gostaria.
355457615	Hah... as palavras me falham, e por isso vou continuar assistindo.
1136573202	Um pouco de retoque... Sim... Agora você está simplesmente deslumbrante.
120801768	Hah... Mary. Você é o única.
1750395949	I'll lift the key from her. But the guy on the balcony seems a little too fixated on her.
461350108	Let's blind him a little with this perfume.
1306362270	Higgins must have been planning this wedding for years.
251910601	Never could keep his eyes off o' me, the filthy old hound.
922690438	Hm, time to make an impression!
1187816162	Got it. Now, up the stairs and through the door to the library.
743034490	Where did I put that dang key?
1148693293	Must have dropped it somewhere... 
1317241360	Did I put it somewhere? No...
922549237	Better find that key.
744683620	There's the door. I'll slip inside when no one's watching.
407399074	There's the door. All I need is a key and an opportunity.
479656838	Now for a little game of hide-and-seek.
337509115	Almost there and now to find these papers.
2105528876	It must be somewhere here...
1764966549	Oh shit...
2078638868	...
1971500671	Ah! Frank! I see you found my office.
477042633	You sure keep your friends waiting, Higgins.
1348339021	Sorry about that. The wedding, you understand.
1857532016	Of course.
901135896	There's the food, the decorations, the blasted relatives...
1234949161	Let's get this done. I got a train to catch.
1632570446	Of course. Just give me a moment.
1559208350	Did I hear correctly that there was trouble in Flagstone yesterday?
177296743	The usual.
1268031842	I can imagine Mr. DeVitt isn't too happy about that.
1403180857	DeVitt isn't here.
1027159589	I wonder if he'd want you to leave things unfinished here.
508971626	Or is there something more important in New Orleans?
1686580200	Maybe you should just get back to your wedding, Higgins.
2140636003	Maybe you're right. Wouldn't want the bride to get nervous.
618313073	Well, she has every reason to be.
509176289	Pardon?
957048501	I don't think she'll be happy when she finds out you sold off her family ranch.
65486749	Well she doesn't have to find out until after the wedding, right?
1577482962	You know...
1458579540	I don't think it will make much difference in the end.
1545128584	Enjoy your wedding, Higgins.
747090136	Wait a second.
1626459034	I need a drink.
1333383276	VO TRACK
430507432	Sure you want to do this alone?
336265342	This ain't a discussion.
190550738	So, what's your plan?
193984684	Get in. Find Frank. Do what I came for.
1758912559	In the middle of a goddamn wedding.
1070686913	I'm just going to pay the mansion a visit. If he ain't there, I'll find someone who knows his whereabouts.
498101810	March through the front gate?
2104851491	There's a path down those cliffs.
974842030	I'll just follow that, then climb up those vines. From there I'll wing it.
1043880601	That's no plan, amigo.
428475223	I've pulled off flimsier ones.
2069318595	If I think something's up I'll come and get ya.
1667387460	No, you stay put. This is my fight.
1423983679	Whatever you say, amigo.
991484945	VO TRACK
902738457	You're not on the guest list, pal. So piss off.
1293803408	That would have been too easy.
449006391	If I want to go in the front, I should try the balcony.
471148704	It's risky, though. The cliff path looks like the wise man's choice.
445190409	That's not like Frank to just ride off like that.
1766187889	Would you wanna stay around and babysit the mayor if you could get out of it?
273883946	Fair point. He sure didn't look happy after he spoke with Higgins.
677460149	I ain't never seen Frank look happy.
2035275044	Damn it. Sounds like Frank ain't here no more. 
576632710	All right, new plan. Find the mayor and find out where Frank went.
1540788717	Looks fancy here. Wonder who's getting married?
737427389	Better keep my head down. Wouldn't wanna break any of these fine things.
1895276229	Pretty cozy in here. Looks like the mayor's doing all right for himself. 
114689045	Something's going on in that room. Let's have a look.
1932598923	This is one of the strangest wedding gifts I have seen in my whole life.
636323351	Yeah... I mean it's expensive and all, but for a lady?
1995670140	What would a bride even do with that thing? 
1855027666	You can't hang it over the fireplace, that's for sure.
717136598	Wish I could have seen her face when he told her about it.
1086193121	Probably the same face she'll make at her consummation, heh.
1911861564	Heh, let's give this wedding present a spin. You ready?
589429187	I'm on it! Don't push me!
1594987651	Hurry up, will ya? Who cares now if you get a few scratches on it?
1034382140	I know, I know. Still...it's a gorgeous piece of steel.
617116496	Still can't believe he would gift her a Gatling gun of all things. Are you done?
1055613052	I said I'm working on it!
1474974179	You've no decency you thieving two-bit excuse for a man.
862254333	Sweet pea, please. I only want what's best for you.
1545196577	You sold us out to the DeVitt Company, you asshole!
1126450539	I'm offering you more than your uncle ever could give you.
1217112426	Yeah, minus the dignity! You really think I'd marry a conniving charlatan?
388367484	Of course you'll marry me! You just need to calm down a bit.
72594872	You're nothing but a greedy fuck!
1002971965	Please, Kate. This is neither the time nor place. 
1864219994	What's going on out there?
1881586802	Don't change the subject.
566744481	It's done. Nothing I can do now.
902581311	Call him back.
1987853092	Kate, please. We have a wedding ahead of us. Now calm down, will you? Time's wasting.
876491346	You really still think I was going to marry you?
841686256	Enjoy your wedding.
260721492	Not so fast.
761492483	You have no idea how much I've invested in this.
1407627867	You will marry me today. You're gonna play the good little wife.
1648400702	I bet you'll forget all about your old life after you pop out a few children...
2065119550	Tempting, but I must decline.
934735454	What the hell are you doing, Kate.
592964750	Just trying to be convincing.
623250118	Yeah? Well I'm gonna show you your place in this world you stupid bitch!
1993616946	I think I know my place.
269045010	I reckon he deserved that.
1780549025	Who the hell are you?
2002065500	I could ask you the same.
1505156800	I don't have time. Step aside.
1095420173	You sure you wanna go this way?
1587660357	To the office! Move it!
1158869171	Shit...
1191932699	What the... Open the fucking door!
1340907196	Here, take this.
1094357658	Case closed.
1933517287	Okay. What now?
2060827302	Balcony door?
1357973747	Works for me.
1028424012	Wait...
1353910226	After you...
344475980	What are you doing?
1635306417	He doesn't need that money anymore.
27232758	Money, huh?
1096591823	Heads down.
776014609	Right...
1882838347	VO TRACK
292715931	Close call. They're gonna search everywhere now.
1145433945	I have to warn my uncle. Let's get outta here.
1792374695	Tell me something first. You ever heard of a guy called Frank?
1833440361	Yeah. Let's discuss it on the way, if you don't mind.
2060148700	They're already at the exit.
911867708	No chance we'll get through there. Not without some serious firepower.
1077110195	In that case, I got just the thing.
156069465	You know how to pull the trigger of a Gatling gun? 
2104072185	Sure do. But why's it have a pink ribbon?
1209102237	It's a wedding present. Don't ask.
1430275831	There's something under that tarp that'll swing the odds in our favor.
798352105	How do you know?
689852558	Just take my word for it.
1540187996	Anyway, I don't think I'll get very far in this bloody dress.
1855414122	Let's visit that maid up on the stage. I can steal her clothes and use them to blend in.
1621639444	Sure, though I don't see a gal like you blending in anywhere, Miss...?
512692986	O'Hara. Kate O'Hara. I'll take that as a compliment, Mister...?
521796706	Cooper. John Cooper.
1496448022	Fuck! Somebody shot the mayor!
639672728	The bride's gone! She killed the groom!
1225173145	Find her! Justice for the mayor!
309618207	Let's go.
1782741770	So. About Frank. Any chance you know where he went?
364637150	I might. Can you offer me something in exchange, Mr. Cooper?
1182502649	How about my undying loyalty until we escape?
92142602	I'll take that...and what else?
1588798955	Ouch.
297422345	What? Better than a knife to the throat I'd say.
1014899815	Not sure which would hurt more.
1484166997	Didn't take you for a man who throws away money.
941177694	It's just pennies.
1182331635	Every penny counts, Mr. Cooper.
802535957	Not if they're fake.
1974330741	What's that. Tear gas?
498428045	Perfume from my late suitor.
1935147382	Guess love is blinding after all.
1101901108	Aww, shame on you, Mr. Cooper.
720571811	Did you hear? Higgins, he's dead! Shot by the bride!
868075080	Serves him right. The man was a pig.
731386092	Yeah, but who's gonna pay us now?
567406958	Let's try this on for size.
640060977	What do you think?
2041445366	You look like a wolf in maid's clothing.
1217012512	You think it's enough to fool 'em?
1460314969	Only one way to find out.
1884587857	Gotta admit, I'm surprised he didn't recognize you.
1681913016	Like most fellas, he wasn't looking at my face.
499448922	I'll ask again: Did any of you see her?
1928826121	Come on, we were all working outside when it happened.
1222371587	One of you must have seen something!
1677419652	Hear that, girls? He thinks we got eyes in the backs of our heads.
447174439	You shut that mouth of yours. The mayor was killed, goddamnit!
1805072825	How dare you talk like that to a lady?
115155553	Halfway out of here.
2144097449	So, what was that back there about warning your uncle?
268460550	The DeVitt Company's gonna attack my uncle's ranch tonight. I gotta get word to him.
48576019	I can see the front yard.
1842114263	You're a capable hand, Mr. Cooper. My uncle could use your help at the ranch.
340742953	Sorry Miss O'Hara, not my line of work. 
1435245677	Till death do us part.
1625001806	That's one for the mantelpiece.
1768815376	We're almost there.
763047119	Careful! That's a guard dog up there!
1066570000	She'll sniff me out no matter what I'm wearing. She hates me.
2057229177	There's my wedding present.
607461779	Mind if I get to know that Gatling gun?
87458527	Be my guest, Mr. Cooper.
1155809389	No one's getting past us.
552666622	Yeah, no one!
154183202	What do we do to those who try?
368160157	We blast them to hell!
254122982	I'm gonna shoot the bride.
493948723	Who else are you gonna shoot?
1291004577	I'm just stating the facts.
536737837	We're both gonna shoot her.
1357399231	Finally! I was bored out of my mind.
1730419139	Yeah! This is much better than standing guard.
1015377852	Yeah!
1773547026	Yeah!
1976088822	She's taking her sweet time.
1365178845	You got somewhere to be?
31526118	No. But what if one of us has to take a shit?
1301700250	Didn't think of that.
785858666	Listen, Mr. Cooper. If you help us defend the ranch. I'll tell you where Frank went.
1017997375	You drive a hard bargain, Miss O'Hara.
1524332823	I simply know how to play my cards.
2103800130	...
1379623079	S-sorry. I'm awake. I'm awake.
2082464810	So you must be Mr. Cooper's friend.
1021821316	Ah? And you are?
795025389	Kate O'Hara. Pleasure to meet you.
1885788602	Hector.
1009054117	So, uh, how was the wedding?
352886229	Stop trying to impress the lady. We're heading out.
545326494	Listen, I got someone that could help us, damn good marksman.
924866641	Thing is he doesn't work for free.
1980239591	I'm sure Higgins has no objection to this investment.
2075204433	Hector, you go with Miss O'Hara.
1532121296	I think we'll have until sundown before the DeVitt men come for the ranch.
428872947	I'll see you there.
353004801	You got it, amigo.
1396775620	Thank you, Mr. Cooper.
1049066160	No need to thank me. We have a deal, don't we?
1690792622	This Frank must be a hell of a guy if you risk your life like this to find him.
1959489870	Wouldn't be the first time.
935716525	Well, you better hurry. We'll be ready for you at the ranch.
163232293	Let's hope so.
1694366016	So...why are we defending a ranch now?
465742076	It's a long story. I'll explain on the way.
1094394493	Sure.
1864486523	VO TRACK
1990009555	Enter the Main Lodge
741079595	Get in through the library door. You will need a key.
1810415810	Search the Desk
1310171821	Steal the document from the mayor's desk.
435856407	Enter the Main Lodge...Again
1298498881	Sneak onto the compound and climb the vines to get in.
1485659679	Enter the Office
718715566	Something's going on in the mayor's office. Investigate.
1710934054	Escape
1341117719	The guards know you're here. Escape from the compound.
23442853	Get a Disguise
1982850193	Steal the maid's clothes. Kate can use them to move freely and distract guards.
344950642	Use the Gatling
197460425	You can take control of the Gatling gun to clear the guards.
1086187692	Pile of Crates
306521944	This pile of crates looks unstable. A shame if it would collapse over somebody's head.
1822264759	Loose Rock
530414943	This rock looks loose. A shame if it would fall onto someone.
1453166023	Gah...shit...!
776792294	Heh, stop hitting your damn thumb.
1748457233	S-sorry, Mr. O'Hara!
1065855255	We are as ready as we're gonna be. Tell the others to head home.
1364684202	Got it. Good luck sir.
831879383	Hector! Is that the last of the tar oil?
600220325	Sure is. We poured the others out like you asked.
1684722420	We gonna put some fire under their asses, ha ha!
293604418	Hey! Look who's there!
1504803829	Ahhh, the reinforcements have arrived! Glad you two could make it to our little barbeque.
1981540590	Who's the scarecrow, amigo?
530391811	The name's McCoy, amigo.
234548493	McCoy?! Never imagined I'd fight side by side with a Scotsman. No offense.
1122718315	None taken.
1484168522	Listen, we saw riders coming down the mountain pass.
962755699	All right then, let's get to it.
1454919041	Two of you are gonna stay out here and pick off the bastards one by one.
2029985056	I got a fine bottle of whiskey for the one who kills the most. Deal?
1100291314	Whiskey, huh? You're on. I'm gonna hide down at the boathouse.
1755941760	Good man, good man.
187223591	What about you, Mr. McCoy? You think you can do better than Mr. Hector?
26243217	Like I'm gonna lose to a Neanderthal like that.
1242732138	Keep that whiskey ready.
1029958115	You never told me your friend had the charm of a rattlesnake.
1175549796	Don't worry about him. I'd say we better head inside too before they fall in.
741279526	All righty. Let's show those bastards who's the boss on this ranch.
1246422449	Uncle Ian?
896266522	What's wrong, Katey?
1379256824	This is all my fault, isn't it?
1855239468	What the hell are you talking about?
254762468	If I hadn't lost the deed in the first place...
1849885691	Katey! Higgins screwed over everyone, not just you.
1117551598	Yes but...
818355494	No buts. We're gonna get through this. We always do.
754928013	Hmm, you're probably right.
794437469	Come on, let's show these company dogs why you don't mess with an O'Hara.
229379485	VO TRACK
856640671	Give it up, O'Hara! This place belongs to us now!
1733682931	This is our land, you bootlicking piece of trash!
849210324	Crawl back to DeVitt and tell him that! 
1485037340	Well, sounds like they're occupied. Guess it's time to earn my pay.
1948453459	Company men all over the place. Good thing it's nighttime.
994406047	All I gotta do is stay low and avoid the light.
326169072	What's keeping that big oaf. Don't tell me he's still hiding in the boat house.
118888914	Guess I'll head there and take a look. 
2008600207	First though, I gotta deal with these jokers.
367014084	All right gentlemen. We all ready to raid the chicken coop?
249927159	How are we gonna get through the door?
1771865139	Did none of you have the good sense to bring a fucking crowbar?
1575626325	Excuse me? Who's the leader around here?
2024011345	I recall explicit mention of a crowbar when we talked strategy.
815825224	I recall Bronson telling us he'd pick up one on the way.
716875629	Like hell! You're the one who said that!
2114587059	Shhh! You're gonna draw their fire!
409256347	So, how we gonna get in?
2051690016	Bash in the door?
190386192	They're gonna hear that.
1655177421	Any other suggestions?
757195455	Maybe...
303046139	Hmm...
621045386	Uh... 
1841173362	Unbelievable...
1430196141	We're gonna take this place sooner or later!
860161388	We can do this all day, O'Hara!
724522486	We're gonna shoot you like fish in a barrel.
950029220	I'm losing my patience, O'Hara!
271720026	Shit. Missed 'em.
1352239587	Come on... Damn it.
1419458258	We're gonna get ya.
625259513	I need ammo.
147676223	Whew, almost got me.
1999029116	Give it up already!
2096059088	Let's tear this house down.
1696570090	Crazy motherfucker.
600949272	You ain't getting shit, you corporate fucks!
750683171	Keep it coming! We got plenty of lead up here.
848772340	Heh, this is starting to get interesting.
459879105	Come on, is that all you got?!
1061802792	That's right! Up here!
461033642	You think we're scared of you?!
448504532	Is that a way to treat a lady?!
606402482	Well, that wasn't nice, was it!
614777867	Let's keep 'em busy.
635709396	That's it. Eyes on us.
1054793456	Nice and easy.
760359633	Better keep your head down.
455661388	Good thing I stocked up. A single vial should do the trick.
581166614	I should deal with them before they wake up.
211008066	One problem solved. Now on to the boathouse.
1122305374	They'll see me if I step into the light. Better stick to the shadows.
237203124	Hard to get past in the light. I should snuff out the lamp. Might even lure the guard.
2072621635	I better keep a keen eye on the one with the light.
752518149	Looks like the Long Coats are calling the shots. I better avoid them for now.
2137015596	Listen, here's the plan. We gonna make a huge pile of straw and light it up.
482458506	Why not just burn the barn down?
434562070	Well who's calling the shots here, you or me? 
67913753	Pile it up here. Set fire to the stable when you're done.
193903206	Hey, where's Frank? Thought he's the boss around here not y'all.
1171499585	Shut it! He's off to New Orleans. Now get to work—we ain't got all night.
1965000017	There's the boathouse. If he's still inside, I better check on him.
2018922614	Huh...the door's locked. Nothing I can't handle.
730836046	Thanks for getting that open. Damn door locked itself behind me.
352574572	You telling me a big man like you can't handle a locked door?
564158153	Not quiet like you. Now what did I miss?
709353041	All right, O'Hara! You asked for it!
857210151	Let's pull out the big guns.
1838980389	Sorry boss, we're still waiting for ammo.
1862633060	Jesus, do I have to do everything around here?
858682549	You, come with me to get the damn ammo.
276827080	The rest of you dumbasses keep them occupied until then.
392024934	Things are heating up at the farmhouse. We better apply ourselves.
2111169794	What's our plan?
2076913082	Well my plan was taking out the Long Coats. They're the guys in charge. If they go down, we might stand a chance here.
1352145573	You've come to the right man! Big guys are my specialty. 
328109224	Course they are... 
1367306084	I got something else that might help.
2136646058	See that shimmer on the ground. That's tar oil. Burns like hell, even in rain.
1903521803	We grab a torch from the bonfire, wait for someone to step in, then light it up.
741949541	Well, I guess it's worth keeping in mind.
112793052	Heh, all right let's get going. And don't forget to keep count. I got my eyes on that whiskey.
1851937666	It's your funeral.
1442318204	Almost got'em.
1281498890	Eyes on the cowboy.
1297624675	Damn, that girl can shoot.
1979273179	Give it up, O'Hara!
703200123	Keep shootin' until they're all dead!
94319294	You stand no chance!
2133017517	Keep the pressure on, boys.
66027519	Let's shred this house.
230840420	Damn it, keep shooting!
909085191	It's just three of them, for chrissake!
1794636740	Fuck. Keep missing.
1360160168	You gotta be kidding me.
1253577766	I'll get you next time.
520767185	Goddamn cowboy!
300116359	I gotcha now!
1817428661	Damn that redhead.
1544866090	How can they keep going?!
420055764	Fucking rain... Can't see!
1728456799	You running low? Well too bad!
704996784	I got enough lead for all of ya!
53336037	Get the hell off our property!
2034363984	I'm just getting warmed up here.
1757760529	Have a taste of this!
245055191	Go crawl back to DeVitt!
2139987223	Aww, getting tired? Good!
654347889	Give my regards to the company!
326584701	Stay calm.
1271633240	Keep shooting.
438405843	Shit. Asshole.
1468122423	Hurry up, McCoy.
715350019	Is that a goddamn sawed-off?
575699308	A beauty, isn't she? Found her in that hut.
349225924	Whatever happened to staying quiet.
329877195	Heh, doesn't matter if no one's left standing.
1893103596	Heh, I got the first one.
1625668423	Bom para você.
1462016211	O primeiro vai para mim.
1444993407	Hrm, o próximo é meu
659797290	Essa é uma.
175665438	Dois a menos.
301673563	Isso faz três.
1958539560	E agora quatro.
72423646	Número cinco
1377852766	Seis.

389336902 	Esse é o número nove.
439989574 	E faz para dez.
1310290895	Onze.

1386900202	Estou apenas tomando meu tempo.
1847947834	Hah, eu estou alcançando!
843642707	Você ainda está arrastando.
1779438194	Parece que eu estou lhe alcançando, Sr. Hector.
2127283402	Sim, sim, continue falando.
1780459215	Hah! Cem. Quantos você tem, Doc?
1376515276	Acho que terminamos de contar. Você fez o seu ponto.
1274673224	Venha agora, Doc. Estou sempre aqui para uma revanche.
1257414093	That makes a hundred. What's your tally?
483252041	Uh...think I lost count. Let's say it's a draw.
946595501	That sounds more like capitulating, Mr. Hector.
1873893821	So, McCoy, is it?
654750945	Doctor McCoy actually.
984738874	Heh sure. You're not really a doctor, right?
435477998	If you're lucky one day you'll find out.
909921615	So, you're a doctor. A real one?
1945803513	You have a problem with that?
94561977	Lockpicking. Sharpshooting. You learn that in doctor school?
492046563	I'm a man of many talents.
318284280	Seriously, what's the deal with the giant bear trap?
607534953	Ah Bianca. The love of my life.
1408124644	You gave that thing a name?
307143757	You hear that, Bianca. He's jealous.
247604673	So where'd you find your Bianca.
1799273930	Old blacksmith gave her to me. Said nobody wanted her cause she was too big.
88785221	But not for you.
1301401938	You should have seen her. All battered and rusted up. I had to polish her, clean her, oil her...
343744116	I think I've heard enough, thank you.
742161955	Hah, this is the life.
213146842	I could do without the rain.
599790691	Come on, Doc. Tell me you're not enjoying this.
1154062258	I didn't say that.
1948173722	There's oil in that water.
623908820	That's one of the oil puddles. All we need is to light it up.
425982982	There's a bonfire over there.
455958343	Walking through that puddle is gonna make noise.
1459319665	He dropped the torch again.
72749159	Geez, it's so slippery out here.
1234373977	Heh, burns nice.
746294964	That'll do for a torch.
1211013687	Careful. They'll be able to see us now.
131526907	Lights out. Don't want to burn our cover.
1080289664	Gotta lose the torch, or our cover will go up in flames.
604169385	First Long Coat goes to me.
958345947	I take the second Long Coat.
306293937	There goes the third Long Coat.
1536962921	That makes four Long Coats.
1410937923	Got the first Long Coat!
137940519	Hah! Second Long Coat is mine.
839847499	That's the third Long Coat, right?
921485834	That makes, uh...four Long Coats.
960604760	That's another one.
1970225901	Hah! And another.
1922131533	How many more are there?
716207941	Think that's enough. Let's meet up. I wanna check on something.
137656861	Think that's enough. Let's find a vantage point. I wanna check on something.
1452286693	What the hell happened here?
1882275598	What's going on down there?
672272883	Maybe they got enough O'Hara for one day, ha ha!
1824706243	Idiots!
761689047	What the fuck's taking so long?
1867214104	Get your ass over there!
1334097764	They're gonna use the Gatling gun!
997861838	Go inside!
1858029009	Let's go!
1457965198	What the...
1141883258	...Shoot 'em!
1085889851	Come on O'Hara...
174501637	What is this shit...
1428756778	Argh!
1220725301	Shit...
1469171959	VO TRACK
396838969	We better think of something before they shred the house.
493021535	The old man shot the oil barrel. You thinking what I'm thinking?
1644492674	Hellfire it is.
523802842	What's wrong? Why did it stop?!
418595128	Not sure, let me see...
1085566140	Fix it!
770777228	I'm on it, boss!
1291986625	Why's this happening now?
92601033	It's the damn rain. It kinda locks it up.
990155654	What's taking so long?
1409491060	I'm working on it! I'm working on it!
851410984	Watch out! They're still out there somewhere!
1409026615	Don't let your guard down.
214882046	Stay alert and focus.
852246942	We won't back down.
543055631	O'Hara's ranch will be ours.
1137993192	If you see someone moving in the dark, shoot!
1387287407	The bonfire's dead. Figures.
579074055	Hrm shit. This bonfire went out.
136181357	Means we'll have to make do with the other one.
1204632687	All right, let's finish this already.
849650212	Once more into the fray.
908833840	All right, let's finish this already.
1840939788	This time with feeling.
509918061	What the hell? I'm outta here!
1529098867	Run for your lives!
1852101788	Aww, we finished already? I was just getting warmed up.
1630601283	Can't have enough, can you?
977121288	Come on now, McCoy. It's never enough!
1077800171	Sounds like you two had a good time.
59786473	You sure you're okay, Mr. O'Hara?
387009686	Don't worry son. Looks worse than it is.
1151243254	You really helped us with that barrel, heh.
1786779120	No problem big guy. All in a day's work as they say.
871380817	Hey, Mr. O'Hara—so what about the whiskey?
664888354	Right, right...
588280517	I say we all earned ourselves a glass of O'Hara's finest.
1908172553	Gentlemen, you're in for a treat.
1531879179	...What the...
841866293	Shit...
246974710	Uncle?
811397586	What's wrong?
1395639857	Quiet!
1513047555	Damn fool.
1542774687	Uncle...
1805250660	We really showed them, didn't we?
941575829	Uncle... I'm so sorry...
2079104040	Don't be stupid.
125265372	It's not your fault... You got that, Katey?
69624517	VO TRACK
969888385	Encontre Hector
186064563	Hector ainda está na casa dos barcos. Descubra porque ele está demorando tanto.
1249601770	Mortes de Casacos Longos ({0} de 5)
1144541248	Mate 5 Casacos Longos para assustar os invasores. Você escolhe.
186837690	Campos

1103747779	McCoy quer checar alguma coisa. Encontre-se na posição.
1356586583	Fogo no rabo
1182811597	Pegue uma tocha na fogueira e jogue-a na poça de óleo.
1139956959	Tochas e óleo
1604157719	A tocha pode ser usada para acender poças de óleo. Você pode pega-las nas fogueiras. Lâmpadas derrubadas por guardas mortos ou nocauteados também incendiarão o óleo.
1017498960	Pedra solta
76768848	Esta rocha parece solta. Uma pena se isso caísse sobre alguém.
1455844339	Cano quebrado
1901536544	Parece que o cano está mal pendurado no silo.
2103704041	A stormy night. A tragic memory. What better place to test one's resolve. Welcome back to the O'Hara Ranch.
1862619689	Four victims await their inevitable end. However, not just any method of slaughter will do.
1768873308	My clients want to see spectacle. Crushing boulders, blazing fires—your tools are limited, but extremely effective.
389360937	No other means of violence are permitted. Distraction is key, as Mr. Cooper and his friends no doubt already know.
1956659752	Make do with what you have. Send your targets to the other side. My clients are watching.
262858736	Heh, well done, well done. I knew I could trust you to come up with something truly...spectacular.
546778263	Kill All Targets
260083393	Kill all designated targets.
1896027246	Moe the Pro
1938788065	He's the captain. Relieve him of his duties.
46570838	Felicity Groans
352977799	She's the comedian. Silence her terrible puns.
888523127	Boris the Ham

1272242783	El Pollo Mateo
212114340	The chicken is behind it all. Put an end to its schemes.
1108060531	Environment Kills
819876528	All direct means of violence are forbidden. Make use of the environment to kill your prey.
1533858659	Horses
1086409056	Horses kick out when hit by Cooper's coins. Use this to knock out guards.
230713070	Lamp Guards
1708127694	Guards drop their lamps when they get knocked out.
230369068	Accident
2137124214	Would be a shame if this one was blinded while working.
915142163	Torches and Oil
1389356972	You can pick up torches at bonfires and carry them around. Throw them to ignite areas covered in oil.
1094818449	Alarm
316293683	You can't set off the alarm.
521411584	I hate funerals.
1848347822	Who doesn't?
612157698	This is bullshit. We were too slow.
296559256	You did fine. I should have stayed with him.
76027002	Then we'd bury two bodies today.
44546673	Kate!
615451680	How are you holding up?
733306503	I still can't believe he's gone.
819823984	I know. I just wanna kill the bastards all over again.
1010048128	Thank you, Hector.
532568269	I hate to break it to you, but this is far from over.
1164037571	What do you mean?
1114307721	All the company has to do is send more men with the next train.
1429595592	He's right. We can't win this. Maybe it's time we cut our losses.
714421692	No.
835385637	Then what?
885227267	We blow up the bridge.
1408309784	What bridge?
2027617074	The bridge at Eagle Falls.
1006380252	No bridge, no train, no more pain and misery for the people of Flagstone.
1413203826	I'm going to Eagle Falls and blow their damn bridge to smithereens if it's the last thing I do.
871378757	That's a tall order, miss.
348563740	I'll do it alone if I have to.
969953473	I've seen that place. It's massive, well guarded.
1894985836	Gonna be a risky venture.
221281587	Come on Doc. Kate needs us. You can't walk away from this now.
1019647664	No, course not. You paid me. I'm yours.
1382510156	That's what I want to hear.
165942666	I'll ready my provisions.
1659437782	I'll saddle the horses.
1538176386	We can take care of the bridge, miss. You just stay here, all right?
1440900464	No way, Mr. Cooper. This is my fight. I'm not gonna let you fight it for me.
212712471	Suit yourself.
1083969188	VO TRACK
889048379	I've checked this place out. We just stroll through the camp and we're at the bridge.
2078135170	Now that's a bridge. It'll take a wagon full of dynamite to bring her down.
1957043161	Not necessarily.
1743660643	That there is her weak spot. Target that and the rest will topple like a house o' cards.
1419916468	Now that there's a plan, Dr. McCoy. But we're still gonna need dynamite.
1252686345	They're bound to have some stored around here somewhere. 
359357962	I could use a disguise, too, but I might have spotted just the thing.
1753537232	It'd make sense there'd be dynamite in that hut in the quarry.
473627906	There's also a weapons shed at the shooting range.
581421147	If I was in charge around here, I'd keep that dynamite locked up tight.
1826368698	Yeah, don't you worry. Locks and me are old dance partners.
60159046	So, we snatch the dynamite and head back to the bridge.
1164491433	We set the dynamite and then find some cover. I'll save a bullet so I can light her up from afar.
48647367	Then it's curtains, ladies and gentlemen!
982561129	Then, we'll have to work our way to the train and meet up with Hector.
1563084130	You take it for granted that he'll be at the rendezvous on time?
837850874	This is one fireworks show he wouldn't miss for the world!
1273876159	Ladies and gentlemen, it's showtime!
546845066	The passengers are getting restless again.
1311290023	Gotta pity those poor bastards at the station.
778735770	The mayor's folks scare the bejesus outta me.
540666850	Wait until they hear about the wedding.
410063658	Just so we're clear, you owe me.
1463658617	Come on, Al. We can't go back to workin'!
419272426	Not while those fancy folk are bothering us.
1224735765	Don't care. Shift's over; all rounds are on you.
1096924937	Gonna be one hell of a day.
769310456	Shit. If the damn townsfolk hadn't kicked us out... 
709597017	Bet whoever killed our men at Flagstone shot the mayor too.
955106238	Well, don't let the passengers hear ya.
83241758	I didn't bring you just to watch. Time you pulled your own weight.
986736051	Cute little pea shooter. That for scaring away the crows?
1850548559	My mother's derringer. Elegant and discreet, just like me.
540469812	Not much happening around here.
1129237809	Pretty quiet here.
833802834	Most of the hands are busy working. These guys here are isolated.
760751371	Which means no one will hear their cries for help.
1585813531	Now that's some potent brew.
1631007758	Comes in handy on occasion. Found it in a swamp near Jennings.
379797080	How do we get past the big gentleman?
2052913718	Long Coat standing guard up ahead.
1971869485	Let's not take chances with the Long Coat. First someone weakens him with a gunshot, then the other takes him out from behind.
169622226	Fantastic. We've got ourselves a plan!
269413787	Eyes on the horizon, Katey. Don't look down.
1092167375	You scared of heights?
1855633454	Oh, no. I love heights, but I've never had the time to learn to swim.
890687247	We are good.
1214187754	Glad it's behind us.
720065703	Now we find some dynamite, then we head on down there and send that bridge to the Almighty!
405118588	I never seen someone haul that much luggage.
937834666	Wouldn't want to be her porter.
368972319	A perfect opportunity to borrow a dress. She probably won't even notice it gone.
1886668339	We've been wasting away here for three days, James! This is unbearable!
589968197	What do you expect me to do? I'm not a bridge repairman. They say it's not safe.
1487325896	The bridge looks just fine! 
1248641012	The wedding was yesterday. We've missed the ceremony... We will be the last ones to arrive.
2124596877	Half the family is stuck here as well... I'm sure our cousin won't marry in a church half full.
970763803	He better not!
1805756371	Let's see if I just can't up and lure that guard away from his duties.
1781218184	Don't tell me you're just gonna walk up to him?
2213502	Watch and learn, Dr. McCoy.
177836789	Not bad for an innocent little farmer's niece.
702906308	I've never met an innocent farm girl in these parts.
694538370	You don't say.
1106042257	How big is this place?
1127199583	This place goes on forever.
22539155	Look at all this! The DeVitt Company is richer than Croesus.
70144024	Speaking of which, weren't you under contract with the company?
2135950230	Still would be, if the bastards ever bothered paying for the train job.
164193422	This has a taste of déjà vu.
958208112	We are just like bandits robbing a train.
627433891	Another day, a different train.
162783975	These ladies aren't going to fall for my charms. I'll need to be careful.
1030207198	How much longer is this going to take?
1347156913	It's like I've been saying, it's hard to tell for sure.
240429791	How can you not know? You're the foreman, for chrissake!
367094213	It's complicated, ma'am.
116064958	There are going to be consequences!
9719693	And what form would those take?
900767901	We'll send a letter to the company. Mark my words!
1078604639	You do that, ma'am. You do that.
148871231	And what's this I hear about a revolt in Flagstone? 
1239414576	Rumors, ma'am. I need to get back to work or you'll never be leaving.
1107055388	You are not going anywhere, sir! I require answers!
1539924895	*sigh* You might wanna at least ask different questions then, ma'am.
174426288	She's sure got him nailed to a plank.
1605885846	I wouldn't trade boots with him. I know that.
347424073	Look at her go at him.
1178585689	This is better than a theater play.
97505707	You know we could help him out.
29844750	Nah, I'm having too much fun watchin'.
1444619154	I'm hearing a lot of noise. Must be the quarry.
1931973891	I smell sulfur. The quarry must be close.
342769919	Well, look at that. They're using dynamite. There must be more where that came from.
244137515	That hut looks promising. But I bet it's locked up.
1654035298	I'll need a few seconds to pick the lock. Just be sure and cover my back.
444708279	I better not let that Long Coat see me. He'll know I'm up to something.
628921758	Primed and ready, boss!
1463201002	All right, get your asses back!
1048995285	Dynamite is ready!
1103858009	You heard him! Take cover!
620512677	Say the word, boss.
128780171	Get it done, already!
944592181	This is the one, boss. I know it!
233071578	Blow it to hell and back!
17011869	Shit, my ears.
782686556	Obstacle is still sittin' there, boss.
171282518	That's one stubborn rock!
370283200	Do it again!
1948015562	Gah... God damn all this!
1955214182	Uh... It's still there, boss.
1002188354	You fucking kidding me?!
1172035801	One more time!
1371676688	Interesting...
877088804	Would you look at that...
1022186573	It sure would help if we could only thin out the herd a little.
1460709916	Well there's always the dynamite...
390620212	That's a tad extreme, don't you think?
1180772955	Desperate times, desperate measures.
1372339404	Sorry. Couldn't resist.
2083757734	Accidents happen.
868947400	Whoops. My bad.
470667403	We should see if the sawmill's hiding anything useful.
12095694	Look at this place. Manifest destiny in the industrial flesh.
1963914594	Wonder how often accidents happen around that saw.
767817700	Thinking about causing an accident yourself?
305308674	It sure looks mighty sharp.
1514308810	All right, saw's out.
315219794	Let's put this on hold.
1286456959	The saw's stopped.
210008120	Now what?
188197869	What's wrong with this thing!
457806363	Hey asswipes! Hands off the damn switch!
1571982461	How about this?
125885861	Let's try this.
895599228	Okay now!
106972270	That's gotta hurt.
1491849671	He never saw it coming.
1477068829	Ouch!
1287021037	They're nervous about something.
1787660680	You're too paranoid, my dear.
1055360869	I heard them talk. There's trouble in Flagstone.
949275483	We're here for the wedding! Who cares about that stupid town. 
854008708	Your sisters are having fun with the workers?
311980442	You know how they are.
1078395714	Almost makes me feel sorry for the poor fools.
271994598	Just punishment for keeping us here I'd say.
597138813	This sawmill is crude. Nothing like we have back home.
712736055	Maybe the DeVitt Company's cutting corners.
371345698	I hope not—we are soon going to cross that bridge of theirs.
1009487023	You are such a worrywart. That bridge has held a hundred trains...
383755851	Come on, we gotta take back Flagstone.
453171243	Forget it! I'm not going back.
915380401	It pays double!
1617952781	Nuh-uh, no chance.
2043731081	It's Flagstone. They're a bunch of hillbillies.
782355437	Hillbillies with guns!
948571304	We'll take back the town, easy like.
880261538	Then you go. I'll stay here.
626700481	Don't you want revenge for Jarvis? Wild Marge? McBain?
1225172522	Aw, let them keep their shithole.
1406020804	Cowards, all of you!
1560359473	Go and get yourselves plugged by a grizzly.
1175221139	I'm going up to take a look. Keep your eyes peeled.
1207002502	Do you always wear such tight jeans, Mr. Cooper?
173073461	Beg your pardon?
175856799	Just keeping my eyes peeled.
519723968	These fellas couldn't hit the wide side of a barn.
604204655	Their weapons are of an inferior quality...and unoiled.
260433494	What do you say gentlemen? You reckon we'll find dynamite in that little shed?
32853892	We'll have to unlock the door first.
1057538575	Just make sure the coast's clear so I can pick the lock.
2023607830	Are you trying to miss or hit them bottles?
972631478	Go find a mare and stick your head in something else's ass, Mundy!
1198467201	Yeah! We're practicing here.
1923955990	Well then, be my guest. Practice makes perfect.
1362731343	You hit the mountain! That's progress.
1834827091	Get off our backs, will ya?
195016477	Yeah! We gotta get ready for Flagstone.
1376588066	Carry on then, kids.
981330621	Oh, that one almost hit the shed.
305744695	No it didn't. We're not that bad.
774427399	Yeah! Wouldn't wanna blow the place to smithereens.
920378594	Very considerate of you.
1443350370	That'll do.
64719891	These little things do so much mischief.
1313763565	All right, one bundle of dynamite. Now back to the bridge.
347539793	We're good partners, don't you think?
1370436802	Partners is a strong word, miss.
364038933	Oh come now, Mr. Cooper. Us, together, against the world.
1284435012	Well, after this, it'll be you alone and back safely at your ranch.
1293942551	Yeah... 
715967375	We should come back here when we have the dynamite.
1149243390	The weak point of the bridge is this way. We still need the dynamite.
567326433	So, that's the way we go once we have the dynamite.
1959106679	All right, down we go.
910584940	Down here.
1179515340	Let's deliver the package, gentlemen. 
1542172045	Hey McCoy. You sure you're a good enough shot to hit that fuse?
1812456212	Watch and learn, Mr. Cooper.
568001835	Wonder what's in that shed?
1944227285	What's in that shed down there?
1795827190	Looks like a storage. Might be a good idea to stock up.
264359659	Yeah, this place is going to be all fire and brimstone in a few minutes.
1953104794	If we find dynamite in there, I'm gonna be angry.
1187055807	Wish we had some dynamite.
1086767789	Guess we still need some dynamite.
629756946	That's the spot. Now we better fetch that dynamite.
1799703722	McCoy. You got the dynamite.
954065528	Miss O'Hara, you got the dynamite.
315914925	Mr. Cooper, you have the dynamite.
297109476	Miss O'Hara, you have the dynamite.
25881207	Mr. Cooper, I believe you have the dynamite.
1498994161	Dr. McCoy, I believe you have the dynamite.
851862061	Primed and ready.
563175063	Package delivered.
543245308	All right then. It's your show, Doc.
621623831	I suggest we head somewhere with a good view. 
706512754	Down she goes.
1149997624	Holy hell!
1444349089	You weren't kidding, Doc.
1464740422	What the fuck. Get me the bastards that did this!
686524713	Thank you, gentlemen. Now, let's hurry—we got a train to catch.
727099477	And no reason to stay quiet anymore.
837828466	This is gonna get wild.
900039237	Now might be a good time to stock up at the shed.
160884714	If you wanna stock up at the shed, now's the time.
2137734687	Last chance to visit the ammo shed.
508171541	Damn it, we got split up!
1412696367	Hah! They did it! Time for Hector to make an entrance.
923656247	Aww, nobody here yet? Looks like I have some time to kill.
412402408	Look who's here already!
1857699596	Hey Hector!
1526833903	You're a sight for sore eyes.
528508594	Not sure how I got here so fast.
1461714705	Everybody, on the train! Let's go!
1872561895	This is unacceptable.
649134575	I demand an explanation!
774090547	The bridge needed repairs after all.
889332417	My ears are ringing.
937152207	One of the workers' fault, no doubt.
1001922886	Who's in charge around here?
767732451	Somebody fix this!
379721079	What about the wedding?
931884521	Sabotage! The wedding is ruined!
513034060	The company will hear about this!
465358707	That's it! We're going back to New York.
1066072200	Shoddy construction, I'm sure.
2106777995	Fuck me, I ain't gonna clean that up!
554237110	Hee hee, that's a fine mess.
1964142030	Oh boy, that ain't good.
542120794	Maybe it looks worse than it is.
2120122482	Oh fuck, the boss ain't gonna be too happy.
19146104	Just a pile of rubble, shit!
1827785997	What a mess.
1951619030	Somebody screwed up royally.
998446281	Who's gonna clean this up?
1712523335	The day's getting better by the minute.
1363115976	Somebody's gonna lose their head.
1320985533	That's a lot of money up in smoke.
1093647381	We got saboteurs!
1280364308	I bet they're still around.
2095213637	Oh, they ain't getting through me.
190822342	They blew up our damn bridge!
437419556	Don't you dare let anyone through.
1081548460	They'll have to come through here.
1542451804	Fucking saboteurs.
1961107717	Nobody blows up our bridge and gets away with it.
692793106	Keep an eye on the door! 
283288489	Nobody's getting in here!
1976578375	Focus, you piece of shit!
1127203636	This won't happen on my watch.
1115120634	Secure the goddam train!
78326914	Fire up the engine!
1276707754	Pegue a Dynamite
1335003154	Encontre uma caixa de dinamite e pegue o que você precisa para explodir a ponte.
704089349	Pedreira
1544104025	Eles estão usando dinamite na pedreira. Está sendo armazenado em uma pequena cabana.
1016138534	Campo de tiro
502956785	Há um galpão de armas na galeria de tiro. Lá você encontrará dinamite.
1896043261	Plante a dinamite
1943625003	McCoy encontrou um bom ponto para a dinamite. Vá até a base da ponte e coloque-a.
171903277	Atire a dinamite
291821293	Tire todos da ponte e faça McCoy atirar na dinamite de longe.
2036498134	Encontre-se no trem
404539240	Hector está esperando por você no trem. Reúna todos lá e fuja.
1529195657	Mine vagão
1283000525	Parece que esse carrinho de mina pode ser esvaziado na cabeça de alguém.
853128941	Troncos soltos
1657385379	Estes troncos soltos mal conseguem sustentar-se graças a uma prancha de madeira frágil.
1138078354	Serra automática
627733433	A serra pode ser ligada e desligada através deste conduíte. As possibilidades são infinitas... 
979219862	Detonador de dinamite
1321641468	Os trabalhadores da pedreira usam um detonador para explodir a dinamite. Espero que ninguém tenha detonado antes do tempo...
1648999959	Você tem certeza disso?
1589189604	Absolutamente. Eu não terminei com DeVitt.
626579769	Prefiro que você fique no seu rancho.
1158182381	E eu prefiro ver o que você tem.
1249377458	Se você insiste.
676274750	Droga! Não é o meu dia de sorte, parece.
780963820	Outra partida?
1334665606	Eu acho que estou bem.
1145524796	Eu te avisei. Ele é um maldito trapaceiro.
329291194	Como se eu tivesse que trair você.
978657549	Uh oh... finalmente!
1761512886	Confie em mim, vale a pena esperar.
615469602	Então, e o trem?
57342294	Descartado. Não precisamos ir a Nova Orleans.
1468187789	O que há em Nova Orleans?
1559859946	Apenas uma recompensa antiga que eu quero alcançar.
271702602	Frank, não é? Eu conheço esse rosto. Trabalha para a Compãnia Devitt.
352808776	Deixe-me ver.
1142906383	É uma foto antiga. Quanto tempo durou essa caçada?
1774780375	Longo o suficiente. Vou terminar em Nova Orleans.
2014707239	Acho que todos temos nossos problemas...
1863626746	Hector, tem um sabor incrível.
241596674	Ahhh... eu te disse!
432917295	Um pouco salgado, eu acho.
2144731839	Não, definitivamente falta sal.
1142770674	Bem, Kate, parece que ainda resta mais para nós dois.
2113674128	Eu não disse que não quero mais.
76782430	Apenas não é bem temperado.
1956219847	VO TRACK
236941690	...
2061939657	Papai...
911979634	VO TRACK
1398730384	I gotta get to Pa.
1903729066	No way I can take them up close.
497952242	I gotta try and throw the knife.
1653273505	He couldn't have come alone. Spread out!
1433914304	And watch the bridge. Nobody crosses it.
1496802357	Goddamn bounty hunter. How'd he find us?
1267055176	Beats me. This is bad news.
1830383815	Maybe they came through the canyon.
409548749	Nah. We would've seen 'em.
1046132865	You saw what he did to Jenkins?
719125003	Yeah. Would've been me if I wasn't out for a piss.
1470063504	I hope Frank gives it to him good.
55717411	Yeah. Hope he takes his time with the bastard.
258047790	That's right, keep searching.
409357586	Ain't nobody getting past us.
951814132	You heard Frank. Keep looking.
552945960	If someone's here, we gotta find 'em.
6871520	Don't let anyone slip through.
337035208	There's so many.
1118829422	I gotta find Pa. He went to the chapel.
998580226	Oh shit, they found a body.
1319330181	What a fucking mess. 
1642434315	Frank's gonna make him pay.
1504792412	Fucking Jenkins. Damn shame.
569912221	I'm gonna miss the poor fucker.
1998724555	You think he saw the guy? Before it happened.
726025267	Don't make much difference now.
680930686	You think there's more of 'em out there?
864070314	If so, they're probably long gone.
1964889272	Okay, Pa must be in there.
1661680174	There's no way I'll get through that gate.
73252538	I gotta find another way.
1179369332	I'm coming, Pa.
662144497	James Cooper, huh? Never heard of you.
6099812	Wonder who set you up. Was it that fool, the marshal?
154832828	Come at me alone. You must be pretty sure o' yourself.
652404764	Or full of it. What's my bounty at these days?
1160052742	Doesn't right matter, I suppose... You ain't gonna be collectin'.
689138457	I do have a question for you that could end your sufferin'.
496735119	You're a fool, but not fool enough to come alone.
993438516	Tell me, how many you got with you?
580223186	This is your last chance.
663168774	I came alone.
1616650886	Bullshit.
1112519194	Elliot.
651456391	You killed my friend.
250763909	Be sure and say hello to him, in hell.
652483574	...!
925633400	Johnnie!
1683143520	Well well...
104755187	Leave him alone!
491008808	Now who the hell are you?
1157756567	Name's John Cooper and I'm gonna kill you!
652495633	Is that right? And how are you gonna do that?
1228726418	Just leave him out of this.
1546012519	You know, in my time...
1226585155	...first thing a father taught his son was how to fire a Colt.
815966713	You bastard! 
2079824983	One good shot, kid.
721607770	That's all it takes.
1391241714	Come on, I ain't got all day.
1517922562	I'm gonna count to three.
1480808491	One.
1591580887	Two.
1869267036	Pa... 
1183621720	I know, Johnnie...
260618180	Three.
720854915	VO TRACK
479913659	Get to the Chapel
1518553472	Your father is in trouble. Head for the chapel and find him.
132779930	Ugh... My head...
1786629121	Where am I?
1470247001	And where the hell are the others?
210326211	All right, first things first.
1083621896	Good morning Hector.
1766685889	Uh... Good morning...miss.
251244019	That was one hell of a night.
488904519	Actually...I don't even remember how I got here...ugh...
1930594328	...or how we met.
2121783391	Hehe, you don't remember anything, do you?
1631687239	I'm Rosie, the sheriff's wife.
693817541	I...I really gotta find my friends now.
1981144447	Bianca...
563836146	What's wrong darling? Lost something in the heat of the night?
324536951	You mind if I just borrow this?
923270363	Sure, but only if you promise to return it.
2059420659	Okay Hector...you can do this...
439696658	Uh...listen, I'm sorry, but...you know...I really have to...
725255672	Bye, Hector.
1042899231	Bye.
1399123022	All right, let's find the rest of the pack.
1841183449	And Bianca.
1532588613	VO TRACK
461225303	Off with you, now! Skitty skat!
2077487744	Don't fret for me. I'll be fine.
1889798138	My husband is a jealous man.
447366367	Get goin'. He'll shoot you on sight.
1467051907	That sure was a wild night.
1104810743	Stay clear of Baton Rouge for a while.
156226262	I do hope we meet again someday.
100047546	My head is ringing like a church bell.
1783238342	Mud. Mud means footprints. And I got big feet.
1673735055	That guy... Is he looking for me?
1508570502	Hey, what did I do to you?!
40883198	Shit, this is bad. I better find the others.
1166266992	Okay...you're not Bianca. What can you do?
1223273402	Not bad. You're a keeper!
1958053994	Wait... This is where we got split up...
949532076	You sure this is right?
1907330953	All signs point to here.
2135184052	What are you, a Mohican?
310638060	Go shave your ass, Hawkins.
968169133	There's no one here.
225376933	You wanna go to the sheriff and tell him that?
709127354	Hell no! He's in a mood to hang someone.
2137721353	We keep searching until we find someone.
1797298500	Why'd they do it anyway?
752847137	They were strangers. Who knows?
1803490372	Sure seems to me like we're missing something.
189560826	Don't worry about it. We find them, we shoot them.
461826097	Hey, amigo!
478403291	Come on Cooper! Rise and shine!
1021256014	Ugh... Feels like I got kicked by a horse.
530886839	Kate! Wake up.
1344104697	Hey Kate! You with me?
730046734	Uh...God! My head's going to burst wide open.
899359207	Where's Doc?
254775759	We need to talk partners.
668724194	Whoops! Sorry, ma'am.
1826510593	Can someone tell me why I punched her?
699751414	She "feel" suspicious-looking to you, too?
1134149982	That woman's a walking bank!
2118301434	That's too much money for an honest woman.
980119931	Where the hell was she hiding all those dollars?
2144249786	Heh, why not?
752645794	We might as well.
194532124	Could come in handy.
211093556	What the hell happened? Where's Doc?
1340885963	All I remember is drinking in the saloon.
46517177	That horsepiss couldn't have gotten us drunk.
541275585	Well, whatever happened here, we made a fine impression on the locals.
517556967	Let's find Doc and get the hell out of here.
338942374	I could use a disguise too while we're at it.
437235839	Doesn't it feel like we're overlooking something really important...
439599327	The boat! He said it's departing come morning!
1926548427	Did he now. The nice man is still waiting for us.
14030696	All the same, let's hurry. This is no place to be left behind.
476190830	All right, all right. We find Doc, board the boat and forget this ever happened.
1710861253	Hey, you see my knife? Or my guns?!
849892578	I'm missin' the axe.
1640469646	Have you seen Bianca? I miss her.
1939241309	I think we stowed our weapons on the boat.
1471959315	Whose good idea was that?
1614108276	Hey! There's a poker tournament tomorrow.
1917005219	Fancy yourself a contender already?
1503626948	I beat you last night. Bet you chose to forget.
1985589116	And the sheriff's cannon went off by itself and blew up the water tower.
655569411	By itself? Since when do cannons shoot on their own?
1248339686	Why'd someone do such a thing on purpose?
2120877139	Dark calling, Barney! The dead rise up and all that.
1921755521	You trying to scare me, Milly.
971291333	I tell you this is just the beginning.
27656303	Who would be able to even calculate that ricochet angle?
1850288950	Look at those marks. Was that a claw, or just an axe?
2104481270	Did the safe get dragged here? Or...was it...dropped from somewhere?
193170982	I don't think this is the work of humans. Something feels really off.
81079969	That's a cannon.
930411529	Take a gander at that cannon. She's a beauty.
2010098878	What's the cannon aimed at?
1089594563	That's a bank safe. Looks heavy as sin.
63030906	I sweat just looking at it.
1308121975	Poor sweet Rosie. It's the devil's curse, I tell you.
24326689	I tell you the swamp witches got her. Turned her into straw.
410986488	Oh, please! It's just a scarecrow, you fools!
626605032	Shut your trap, Freddy! You're muckin' up the investigation!
577082853	Well sure, but why'd they climb up to the club rooftop?
814666945	They must have had a lookout up there. To warn 'em if things went wrong.
2050937557	What's a swamp witch spy look like, anyway?
262680794	I don't know, Francine, but I'm not looking to find out.
547428213	So they rolled the cannon out of here?
1004944109	For the dark rising! Stealin' it for their lair.
1435677527	Lair? What do you mean by that?
510354877	They're swamp witches, Bert! That's where they perform their rituals!
449994866	So, you think the cannon they stole here was necessary for their rituals?
2101465176	I'm not quite sure, yet. Let's keep looking for clues.
81163414	So, is it true? Was it really him?
804922990	Sure looks like it. I can hardly believe it myself.
200960381	Satan the bank robber. Must have been a sight to see.
342965924	What does he need money for?
1406510762	What does anyone need money for? The saloon.
843420653	I bet whiskey's even more expensive in hell than it is up here on Earth.
39489661	Satan robbing our little bank. Ain't that just dumbfoudin'.
56293856	I have a hunch that it's all connected. Him, the chickens, Rosie...
1916294871	Whoa, whoa, easy there. Now you're letting your imagination scare yah.
362876219	Why'd they break the gate? 
462142916	Who made them? The devil?
1464992197	Who else? Drove them mad.
27909581	Poor beasts. Scared to death.
1832148011	Wild eyes.
1184230511	Like they seen the devil.
1648027237	Cause they did.
610440517	Lord have mercy.
1364331509	This town is cursed.
1743208315	The day has come! Mark my words!
1990997190	What we hold dear, it shall be lost.
877579202	What we hold sacred, it shall be defiled.
1006373769	What gives us strength shall turn to ash.
552648979	For the enemy has risen! Lord have mercy!
1392107080	Three days ago, in Baton Rouge, he revealed himself.
1535420739	He terrified the brave townsfolk. 
589176724	He laid waste to the city bank. 
272295453	That was only the beginning!
321098349	The end time, it is upon us.
1997996972	The world will burn and be cast anew.
1797927460	And all the good and all the evil...
1775735198	All the old and all the new...
1798833391	Will have to stand in judgement of the Lord!
1327253338	May he have mercy on our souls.
2006344400	Safe been ripped right out o' the wall. Floor's covered in hoofprints.
538003243	Then it's true. Satan himself was here last night.
2024803270	I saw the bastard. Wearin' a long black coat, and big horns, like those unto an ox.
136615385	How we ever gonna lock up the devil?
868949280	We should call the pastor. He'll know what to do.
1594392271	Maybe. The sheriff seems to be way over his head, ignoring our theories and all.
1479984106	Well...  Guess we should leave this where it belongs.
1356569465	Hmm... Let's leave this here for safe keeping.
1009113621	It's a pity, but this isn't ours for the keepin'.
1567772064	If I was Doc, where would I be holdin' up?
1577477175	Hey, Doc. You in here?
2129400880	Where are you, McCoy?
1554146086	Doc! You need to wake up!
254795236	McCoy! Wake up, sir!
1726557802	Hey Doc! Rise and shine!
377597252	...
133096306	Is that a hoofprint on his face?
88700969	He's not wakin' up any time soon.
1606989506	Well, then we carry him. The boat won't wait.
1881620348	...
3526963	...
1732022279	...
428310486	...
601364948	...
1440495828	...
328688949	Rnn... Rose... Roses...
1514831626	What's he saying? Something about roses?
1660233075	Maybe he's dreaming.
845827971	Rrnn... Drink... Drinks...
402891133	Now he's thirsty. Must be a salty dream.
496985104	Think his dreams are trying to tell us something?
2004312653	How did they grab her anyways? Rosie's a smart girl.
96204554	Maybe it was some kind of voodoo spell? Heard they can control people's minds.
1846003513	Mind control? Now that's the stupidest thing I've heard in my entire life.
819462486	Just something I heard, that's all. Strange things are happening.
1211276023	This is a free country, Sue. Ain't no spell enslaving my free will.
349599389	How would you even know if you were under a spell, huh Stan?
2055929743	I've been talking about this for months, you know.
1179320602	You and your crazy theories.
1529553374	It's happening! I told you it would! The devil, the swamp witches, everything!
1902893999	Sure, sure...
1256508510	One more day and I'm out of here, man. This town is doomed. I told you!
1043430109	It's just a bank robbery. Happens all the time.
1895506120	YOU believe me, don't you? The signs, you can't ignore them any longer.
1516427400	Mhhh... Strange things have been happening here lately...
861268628	Animals are going mad. The devil's behind all this. As I always predicted.
94138026	You DID say that a lot, yeah... Damn.
71483507	We have to get out of here. The devil's walking among us!
1002422473	Well... Hmmm... I don't know. I'm not used to change, you know?
1471642464	Joshua, listen...
1261020848	Don't you even start. Leave me alone.
404259073	Joshua, it's important.
1256672804	NO! None of your nonsense is. Go away.
326811039	Joshua, please...
41566168	I told you: Stop it!
1173960067	So he's the sheriff?
924426452	There's the sheriff.
651354632	Enter the sheriff.
329328324	Wonder what he has to say...
2133212800	Now, let me get this straight...
705175938	Half of you's sayin' Satan himself robbed our bank.
1039578838	The other half says it's swamp women.
745822232	My dear sweet Rosie's vanished.
1403515838	The money from the bank's nowhere to be found.
544753271	And the culprits what caused all this destruction? Whatever they be... Gone as well.
947974283	Am I listing the facts correctly?
368601354	Actually, it's swamp WITCHES, sir.
1421196470	Listen here, fellas.
1528418798	You gonna turn over every damn rock in this town until you find my Rosie, or so God help me, I'm gonna string you all up like so many frogs on a fishin' pole!
1597898489	Hey! I woke up next to a girl named Rosie. She told me to hightail it.
332489	You woke up...next to her? What are you sayin'?
1484272988	At least we managed to make one friend in this town.
211205121	Wait. I woke up next to a girl named Rosie.
739073601	She was toting a lot of money.
1433373531	You mean the woman carrying all that money?
1263360932	The woman hidin' all that money?
564428196	I bet she's the one who doctored our drinks, too.
1818976632	At least we didn't let her get away with it.
158535185	Well, if she was here, she's long gone, now.
726437457	Hey, where'd she go?
675688247	What's that? Looks like a letter.
776162675	Ahh...help me out here.
2111783617	Uh...here. You read it.
776568948	"So long, fellas. Been a pleasure drinking with you. Stay out of jail. Until next time."
661332741	Now there's a woman after my own heart.
165532200	I bet she put something in our drinks. That was one hell of a night.
1089721530	I got enough of this town. Let's catch that riverboat.
407763384	You took your sweet time.
393908923	Just get us out of here.
1651580696	Fine day for a river ride.
1426800689	Thank you sir, for waiting for us.
902999577	I am chargin' you double, now.
1467735642	All aboard!
550166924	Know someone with toothache?
242393163	I can pull your teeth no problem.
254675861	Need a dentist, he he he?
57218185	My tooth really hurts.
278526034	I can't chew anything. 
1866215532	Argh, my tooth.
254904447	Ahh...a customer! Let's get to work.
1524732424	W-w-wait! Ahhh, ooowaaaaaaaaah!
353958600	What's Going On?
1302257551	Ugh...what the hell happened last night? All right...you gotta find the others.
315240867	Where's Cooper?
18692113	What? How'd he get up there? Well...you better wake him up.
293224231	Where's Kate?
2145455900	Huh? What's she doing over there? Hope she's okay... Let's wake her up.
1894810900	Okay, We Gotta Talk...
1569792280	All right, uh... You should regroup and...talk about...things.
1051569863	Where the Hell is Doc?!
49800793	He's gotta be somewhere...right? You gotta find him. Ask around. Well, not ask around but...you know... Just find him, okay?
2007094801	Let's Get the Hell Out of Here... 
396670543	Oh yeah, the captain's waiting... Well, you better get everyone on board.
1458824417	Have you heard the rumors lately? They say the devil has come to Baton Rouge. Or maybe it was swamp witches. Hard to keep them apart, am I right?
601705098	Anyway, your targets today will be simple men. Siblings, in fact. All part of one big family. And who would tear family apart?
1019050481	My clients want to see you dispose of them. Every last one. The catch? You won't know who you're looking for.
1310209373	Take a good look at this man. His clothes, his hair, his skin. He looks exactly like your targets. Use this to find them.
91495061	Keep your eyes open. Make sure you catch them all. Rest assured: My clients will be watching.
62092261	Nothing like a good hunt to brighten the spirits. My clients are most entertained. Well done.
1903982346	Look at all that plunder.
1740736829	All right DeVitt. Let's see what you keep in here.
41497864	Marshal Wayne.
362786850	I see you're trespassing on private property.
1217983166	Last I recall you need a warrant for that.
2078537816	I don't need a warrant for crooks like you Frank.
1045160565	Just come with us quietly.
175133016	I'd prefer we settle this like in the good old days.
1304765288	Too bad this is not how it's done anymore.
975110150	I think that's the leash around your neck doing the talking.
606901809	Is that right?
537400045	Hey, DeVitt wants the marshal alive, remember?
1017739857	Shut up.
633924663	Come on, Frank, think about the money.
898817121	Right...the money.
280696478	Gah!
636272268	That's all that matters is it?
1788403313	Frank, please, I just...
623899726	Bring the marshal to the others.
604011281	Move it...
635756145	*coughs*
1027025207	So much for the good old days.
138737026	Good old days are long gone, Marshal.
630355938	You really believe that, huh.
1657864457	Get him out of my sight...
213060420	VO TRACK
1912159611	Hey Daryll. Look what I found in the weeds!
86365993	Get your fucking hands off o' me!
946623598	You're gonna regret this.
1341354661	Yeah yeah, whatever.
1531361559	Careful, Daryll. Maybe she's one of these swamp witches.
886565052	Yeah and I'm the fucking president.
174109963	Now get back to your post.
1573593877	Swamp witches...
2026062108	How about it? You gonna put a spell on me?
2060987128	Didn't think so.
1824889548	VO TRACK
887394692	Shit. I must be getting old. And the damn cat left me hanging too.
515828510	All right Isabelle, focus. Gotta get your ass back to Wayne.
1395829384	Hmm, let's see...
1738446069	DeVitt's men are everywhere. Better take things slow.
2054698991	Can't hurt to get a lay of the land. That ledge up there looks like a good vantage point.
716578289	But first I gotta get out of this cage.
927238604	Let's see who is going to help me with that.
1273773824	Don't fuss—we'll take care of you real soon, heh heh.
1997127505	Look at you, all riled up in that little cage, hahaha.
1241511868	Go ahead, witch! Put a curse on me, if you dare! Hah!
1488386937	Get the boat ready, Liz.
438357744	I'm trying. Gotta fix that hole first.
1482365472	Well hurry the fuck up. I wanna get 'em to the Nest.
307372758	How's the boat?
1800497329	Still leakin' like a sieve.
1578357944	Keep at it. I wanna show our catch to DeVitt.
1551555474	Are you done, yet?
1550750422	What's the matter, Darryl? She scare you?
1656789026	I don't like that look she's giving me, that's for sure.
1394711310	I gotta snatch one of them. This is gonna hurt.
49604125	Come on girl. You ain't getting out of here on your own.
377166474	I need a puppet. Just gotta figure out who to pick...
433826434	Gotcha. Now, what can you do for me...
799766794	Sleep tight. You won't remember a thing.
1965927973	That wasn't it. Need to try again.
1472513839	Shit! Missed it again.
1256572982	I'm real tired. Only got one more in me.
547548841	I'm too drained out. Gotta take some jimson.
1751378118	I'm running out of people here.
1497677336	There goes my last chance. How the hell am I gonna get out now?
436142430	And...thank you very much!
728288178	Wonder what else can you do...
963212677	All right. Now let's head for that ledge...
2043091614	Shit, I'm spent. Better take some jimson.
1893654894	Gonna fix me right up.
2072218224	I'll need more venom darts if I wanna make more puppets.
1836229435	Now what are the chances there's some in that crate.
140698329	Heh, would you look at that. Guess this day ain't all bad.
1762427299	What?!
134414187	No, no, no! Where the hell is she?
1114252122	We gotta find her!
101664155	Wait! I gotta head up that ledge first.
1505814395	One down here, one up there. I'll just take 'em both.
607767100	Stella! There you are!
1324229316	*meows*
1340327729	You got some nerve leaving me hanging like that.
710285020	*purrs*
1547392648	Nah ah. You're gonna make it up to me right now.
1799290202	Made it. Now let's get the lay of the land.
853332837	So, let's see what's happening over there. Looks like they caught themselves a little steamboat.
1708763328	That cowboy there is holding his own for now. He's gonna run out of luck eventually.
180287954	Now was he alone? Or did he have a crew?
1775302398	They're looking for someone at that house. I bet someone's hiding out there.
1521339902	Now, that big guy looks freshly caught. Wasn't easy I bet. He has eyes on him from all angles.
819339280	They got a pretty lady, too! Odd collection of characters from that boat.
972713066	These fellas are gonna get sold off by the company if we don't do something.
2069640301	The company's gonna sell off their asses if we don't do something.
1636805222	*meows*
1856030066	Doesn't really matter who we help first. But startin' with that cowboy wouldn't hurt.
572815002	Once we save everyone, we'll make our exit.
2129583524	*meows tiredly*
597420665	Now, you best pull your weight, if you wanna have stew tonight.
676580666	*meows enthusiastically*
462644112	That sounds more like it.
956686779	Hrrr, I hate cages.
762618179	Why they all so scared of me.
234061572	Swear they'd shoot me if I so much as farted.
842489044	This sure doesn't look good.
971666701	Maybe I should have stayed in Colorado.
301719751	If they so much as lay a hand on me...
649581872	The boat and the house look less crowded. Maybe I'll go there first.
1915152557	Okay, let's help out the cowboy.
609887066	Let's look around that house.
1960415117	This is where they keep the big guy.
718322838	There's the lady in her cage.
1034632180	There's Cooper. Looks like they got him pinned down.
194195716	Look! There's Cooper. Those bastards have him pinned.
618721931	There! Cooper! They're still firing at him.
655586820	He's holding out for now. Let's give him some breathing room.
1124333373	Think I saw Doc head in this direction.
2099540363	Hey, where's Doc? Wasn't he with us?
1045115534	Think we lost McCoy here somewhere.
704934038	Maybe he's hiding out in that house? Could be worth a look.
340976707	Shit, there's Hector. They got him.
1281515011	There's Hector. Figured he wouldn't get far.
1288485514	Oh no. They got Hector too.
802011250	He looks pretty miserable in that cage. Let's help him out.
1897278380	Damn bastards put Kate in a cage too.
1824816580	Looks like Miss O'Hara got locked up as well.
1611056678	Shit. They put Kate in a cage too.
1685392268	Bird like her don't belong in a cage. Let's break her out.
293793449	These pricks have their own little outpost here.
2018308304	Wayne's gonna love this.
970766807	Nice little fishing spot. Wonder what happened to the owner.
681296385	One more thing for Wayne to figure out.
958848154	There's a lookout up there. Ain't no ship getting past those eyes.
1619837431	Wayne was right. These folks are well organized.
860018648	Look at that cargo. "Business" must be good this week.
1217862018	Shit... High time Wayne does something about this.
1958100788	Wayne? You got someone else with you?
1696961317	He's waiting for me in New Orleans. I'd be on my way now if I hadn't seen y'all.
305241267	Wayne, huh? Friend of yours?
1543882089	Friend? Heh, yeah sure. Maybe I'll introduce you if we get out of here alive.
415367732	Wayne? Pretty sure I've heard that name before.
1381713793	Don't strain your head too much, Sunshine. You'll break it.
1944581676	I'll find out soon enough.
2062664918	Wayne? Someone I should know?
1542455237	He's just the one who sent me here. Guess without him, you'd still be in that cage.
1901270877	Gatling gun, huh? Made short work of that little dinghy. 
605424394	Maybe we'll give 'em a taste of their own medicine.
2031867883	Bah, that thing again.
882846551	Guess you're familiar with the business end of that Gatling.
1846748898	Yeah right, and I'm in the mood for revenge.
369854531	You've read my mind, big guy.
91209191	What the hell...
2051295956	That's a Gatling gun. Never seen one before?
779468741	Course I have! And this one...seems awfully familiar.
954110533	You wanna give it a spin, be my guest.
988172616	That thing...
1749565000	Gatling gun. Ugly little machine, isn't it.
1974939895	I wouldn't mind throwing it in the river.
1493770634	Maybe we can get some use out of it first.
182306948	These guys are like rats. Maybe the cowboy or head to the house first, get one to help me.
1221124038	It's more crowded here than the boat and the house. Maybe I should head back.
1553085149	Hey why aren't we using the Gatling gun?!
900943188	Hands off! The boss goes crazy if you so much as touch it!
658516183	I got him Casey! I think I got him!
508731454	He's still shooting at us, damn fool!
324970067	Dang it, Casey! I think he hit me! It's all red...
320865517	You're wearing a red shirt, you idiot!
225048499	Gah! My ears are ringing!
1919633944	What did you say? I didn't catch that.
687894890	Hey, let's wait until the boat sinks!
1483628369	To hell with that! We're puttin' this fool in the ground.
1602215951	How you doing up there, cowboy?
435631254	Howdy miss. You mind helpin' me out here a little?
345409256	Whatchu got in mind?
1871676232	Taking out those two shooting at me can't hurt.
1688850805	Heh, I'll see what I can do.
305294730	Guess you're still breathing.
1322983866	How's it going, amigo?
1442504057	How are you doing up there, Cooper?
1895653367	Hey. You mind taking out those two shooting at me?
226564093	All right. You just stay put.
1890359735	Heh, sure. Just wait there.
1660272438	Sure. Wait there.
1587325192	Do I look like I'm going anywhere?
1370896943	All right! Whoever's out there, meet me on the deck.
331485005	Nice work out there. Meet me on the deck.
1033613334	Whew, thanks. I was getting nervous up there.
850111332	Wouldn't be here if it wasn't for her...
2144838521	Don't thank me. Thank her...
1852477209	I think you better thank her...
555906458	Hey cowboy.
1813072875	Uh...hey? Something wrong with you?
1016937040	Just ignore 'em, cowboy. I'm the one pulling the strings.
1007568041	Right. Well, I've seen stranger things.
1190809367	So you're the one I spotted up on that ledge. John Cooper.
1294028435	You got good eyes, Mr. Cooper. Isabelle Moreau.
479043166	Well, thanks for the help Miss Moreau. Come on, let's talk on the way.
424948428	Yeah, we better get going. Some of your friends are still captured.
1840783524	What brings you to these parts, Mr. Cooper?
2095268698	On my way to New Orleans. Can't remember the route being this inhospitable though.
62785543	You haven't been round here for a while.
1472532422	So how'd you stumble into this mess, Miss Moreau?
1365157573	Just looking into what's going on here. Folks have been disappearing.
838073255	And you make it your business to help out strangers?
1792247617	Heh, didn't hurt in your case, did it?
1265190573	For the devil's sake, Baxter. He ain't here.
1645846832	Keep at it. We ain't leaving 'til you find him.
66517096	Mind helping out? We'd sure find him faster.
680240689	Can't you see? I'm looking in here. Now get your nose to the ground.
191782179	DeVitt ain't paying you to sit on your fat ass.
1349901000	He ain't paying you for crying about it either.
221837581	All right, what'd the man look like again?
2045347558	Memorize it. Tall, long coat, mean as sin. 
1813812817	We gotta find him, or we're here all night.
1237361987	Why ain't he helping out, the fat bastard?
1100169350	Don't count on any help from him. How're you doing?
1719301491	Not sure what's gonna eat me first, bugs or the gators.
1192359471	I'm gonna die of boredom here.
1215149422	Maybe we missed something. Ask Baxter about the fella again.
1405760560	Baxter says he's big, ugly and wears a coat.
899670519	Maybe that fat fool just saw himself in a mirror.
942466930	Huh, that trapdoor looks suspicious.
1469223107	Hey Doc! You hiding in here?
98530569	If I was McCoy, where would I be...
575016370	Somebody hiding under that trapdoor?
273228236	The hell? My puppet just died.
1708252235	Guess whoever's down there needs a friendly face.
1213847823	About time someone showed.
2115644560	Would have taken longer if not for her...
1425436776	I'm only here thanks to her...
1904716507	You'd still be waiting if not for Miss Moreau here...
14355310	Hey there.
1929555592	Who the hell are you?
463032935	Isabelle Moreau. And you're welcome.
1581428564	I don't recall asking for your help, Miss Moreau.
392366956	My, aren't you a sunshine.
628719802	Anyway, I think some of your friends are still waiting to be rescued.
1192625616	Thanks for reminding me.
220086571	So how'd you end up hiding in that hole, Mr....?
853303776	McCoy. Doctor McCoy.
710070477	Right. You didn't answer the question though.
761496402	It's called a tactical retreat.
893316439	Why are you still following?
1251724828	Is that a rhetorical question?
1517720005	Look if you expect some sort of reward, I'll have to disappoint you.
194195131	Heh, so that's how it is. Don't worry, Sunshine, I'm good.
1394520851	Ghn...goddamn headache.
1311045368	Nasty shiner. Want some jimson for that?
1788810058	Rough night? I can give you some jimson to soothe the pain.
141632886	Devil's snare? Think I'll pass.
55479136	Ghn...
706380539	You sure you don't want some jimson, Sunshine?
1078701494	Are you trying to poison me, Miss Isabelle?
526892067	Sunshine! It ain't raw jimson. I know how it's prepared.
2127528356	Thank you, but I know what real medicine looks like.
1751667435	Keep your sights on him. He tries anything, fill him full of holes.
1166235436	He looks tough now. Wait until they put him in the mines.
979742090	You must be the biggest, ugliest, hairiest bear I've ever seen.
2013180870	We'll show him to DeVitt. Strong men are worth double.
567407197	I know that cage can't keep you in. But my boys can. Trust me.
389664686	You could have been one of us. Now you're gonna rot in some mine.
344609186	You got me good back there. We're gonna have a rematch later.
1883846390	Hey you! Can you get the key and let me out?
148923462	Heh, don't worry big guy. I got you.
1752239913	Hey! Amigo! Get the key and let me out!
1589604806	Calm down. I'm on it.
899864495	Hey Doc! Get me out of here, will ya!
825361305	Not so loud you idiot. 
1706790544	Sorry... You can crack the lock, right?
568519898	Kate! You made it! Quick, get the key!
1921850393	Easy Hector. We'll have you out in a jiffy.
798651870	Ah, thanks. Damn, I hate cages.
393895812	Whatever. Guess you better talk to her...
1804992490	Better thank her then...
184340124	Then you better thank Isabelle here...
412343447	Hey big guy.
594614678	Hey! You think I'll go easy on you cause you let me out?
928989533	That's just a puppet, big guy. I'm over here.
599999050	Huh? Ah! So you're the one!
1556585124	Thought I smelled someone new. Name's Hector.
293053453	Isabelle Moreau. You got a last name too?
429500815	Everybody calls me Hector. Now let's get going.
642359089	Yeah. There's others that need our help.
768119225	You gotta be shitting me!
582639522	Who allowed that bear to escape! Find him! Or that cage is yours.
531851531	You from around here, Isabella?
883147652	Louisiana born and raised. And it's Isabelle.
406644960	I'm not good with French names.
119973129	So, uh, Isabella... It's Isabella, right?
1143413641	Pretty sure it was Isabelle last time I told you.
1740464407	I'm just gonna call you Belle.
918117087	I like you, Hector.
1240223034	You're a beauty. Shame they're gonna send you to the Queen's Nest.
1894284377	We should have some fun with her on the way, eh boys?
890894308	It's a long way to New Orleans. You can keep us company, hehe.
1376940702	Careful with this one! She's got sass. A mean kick too. 
1443389901	You know what they do to girls like you at the Queen's Nest?
788401811	Don't give me that look, honey. It's just business.
1336357020	Came to see New Orleans, did you? Bet that didn't turn out like you thought. 
1080931051	I wonder what DeVitt will say 'bout this one. Maybe he'll keep her for himself.
810178116	Uhm, hello! Would you mind getting the key and letting me out?
1024056574	Well hello to you too. Don't worry. I got ya.
1011731131	Hey! Cooper! Would you mind getting the key?
224964667	Don't worry, we're on it.
707914472	McCoy! You're a sight for sore eyes!
1976937729	Don't hear that very often. 
1603571042	Quick then, crack the lock.
2015338391	Hector! You made it! Come on, get the key!
373719449	Easy Kate. We'll get you out.
773501524	Damn, I'm glad I'm out of that thing.
592102037	I guess you should talk to her...
1024116081	You got her to thank for that.
328939377	I hear ya. Better thank her...
1824902527	Hey, pretty lady.
413509809	You've come for more, huh? Well come here.
1513128327	Easy lady. They're just a puppet. I'm over here.
908001360	A puppet? Well, this isn't strange at all.
417370763	Where are my manners... Kate O'Hara, pleasure to meet you.
603155133	Isabelle Moreau. The pleasure is all mine, sweetheart.
804556869	Let's talk on the way. I'm sick of this place.
158319368	Right. Others need our help.
1809223422	Wait a minute!
1693093880	Y'all drunk yerselves blind? That bitch got out! Find her!
1232149608	She got out too. Goddamn idiots.
519594574	Let's stay together. The big fella's gonna be a problem.
940005179	Shit. The big fella's loose too.
377143700	He's gonna be trouble. Let's stay together.
604605099	This is your fault! If you took your job more seriously...
1881573874	Hah, funny? I remember you being in charge!
906631689	All our extra pay gone because you lack a brain.
1711192605	If there's someone to blame here it's you.
2088707612	So...we stay here until the big guy turns up?
1269672492	Yup. And then we tell Baxter it's all your fault.
118766212	This your first time to Louisiana, sweetheart?
535305091	Yeah. Can't say it lacks for excitement.
304766618	Hope these bastards didn't mistreat you.
171277424	They tried. I gave 'em a good reason to put bars between us.
62285707	Miss Moreau, I get the feeling you're used to this sort of thing.
1809580148	What? Getting put in a cage? Or breaking out of one?
955579716	One goes with the other.
1720228032	Not always, honey. Not always.
271915314	Well I be damned! That affected both of them...
1711974230	Just a little jinx, sweetheart. Nothing to be scared of.
1819930513	Yeah right. I saw you shoot those poison darts.
1579312449	Riiight! That's how I did it.
1914204443	The hell... What happened to the other one?
1503164335	Don't worry. Just a little jinx.
422801008	Jinx huh? Bet that comes in handy.
1214013721	Heh, you bet.
1418334213	Hmm, I must be seeing double.
816461692	Heh, you're not. Just don't rack your brain over it.
1442181871	Uh, sure. No problem there.
657189663	Wait, it happened to both.
1353534146	Heh, sorry if I scared ya. Just a little jinx.
1102711948	You gotta teach me how to do that. 
1133135825	That's some scary trick you got there, Miss Moreau.
25367564	Don't worry. I can't do that very often.
1820063252	This thing...it works with blood, huh?
1224752034	Everything has its price.
1011953895	Miss, did you just stab a knife through your hand?
846584187	I need a minute. I'm still dizzy.
1738871586	Course you are. Let me have a look at that.
2147385104	Who do you take yourself for...my mother? Just leave me be.
571349077	Heh, that one must have been drunk as hell.
1107568898	Drunk? Sure...
1151122410	What's wrong? What's with your hand?
135221885	Just a little blood. Happens all the time.
2092686027	That was you, wasn't it? You told them to do that.
1115531037	Heh, clever girl...
996745164	You know, I can't say what scares me more: that, or you cutting your hand like that.
58130513	Don't let that bother you, okay? It's what I do.
764336279	That's one smart tabby.
1811135212	Heh, little mouse trap.
2084736654	My she's cute.
1693832557	*meows happily*
880901776	Don't encourage her, it'll go to her head.
994615414	You stay clear of me, cat.
1709952513	*hisses angrily*
219006275	So Louisiana women ain't the only thing you don't like, huh?
676313624	I've got myself enough bad luck. Don't need guff from the cat.
321074469	You sure know how to handle that knife.
1498003334	I had a good teacher.
723343382	Oh, I bet.
1522509438	What the hell is that thing?
1906487015	That is Bianca.
819220515	Bianca?
1101963030	Bianca and I are inseparable. We've been in love from the first day.
1927745749	And people look at me funny.
751212873	Whoo, Sunshine. You didn't tell me you could shoot like that.
315953830	I prefer to demonstrate.
33451991	What the hell do you keep in that bag?
175001448	Want to take a look?
642821681	I'll pass, thank you.
1739021370	Swamp gas, huh? Where'd you pick that up.
369604896	Wouldn't you like to know.
1838063211	Ooohoo! That's a mean kick you have there.
661099035	Believe me, I had lots of practice.
342237194	I can imagine.
1734308612	Ugh, what's that? I can smell it from here.
1746472048	Sorry. Just a souvenir from my latest suitor.
1530861661	I can understand why you dropped the guy.
1869185420	Believe me, poor taste was the least of his problems.
1992215744	You're stronger than you look.
1934589700	I'll take that as a compliment, Mr. Cooper.
1930113270	Ho ho, look at you!
2101621251	Maybe you could lend a hand?
514825315	Oh, I don't think you need my help.
366448526	Yeah...sure.
901697531	You're making me jealous, Miss Moreau.
593524845	Don't be. My back's gonna kill me tonight.
1125819947	Come on Sunshine. You can do better.
1086287296	I'm staying low for tactical purposes.
1164388805	Sure you are.
1691711871	What's the matter, Sunshine. Can't swim?
1788699548	I don't like my tools to get wet.
613581588	Heh, yeah wet, right.
1913285915	All right, I think that's everyone. Now let's get the hell out of here. 
210975084	And how'd we do that? The boat's been shot to hell.
1659885400	Good thing they got horses. Should we help ourselves?
1490637882	Sounds like a plan.
1394938775	Are they still looking? We are gonna be behind schedule.
270830879	So what? Frank won't throw no fuss.
2112444917	You hear what happened back in Colorado?
1119380749	Who cares about Colorado?
2031131537	You ever see the Queen's Nest?
2077031686	Nah. It's company territory. They don't let the likes of us in there.
937461547	I heard stories about that marshal. He's been after the company for years.
367154930	Well, he's gonna see it, from the inside of a cage, heh heh heh.
2048956823	Thank you so much, Miss Moreau. We owe you a great debt.
938025439	That's one point of view.
117805030	Doc, you got a beef with Miss Isabelle?
1161078991	I'm not so keen on owing favors.
2046471173	Oh don't worry, Sunshine. It's on the house.
686362228	So what's your plan right now?
190516923	New Orleans.
1280239266	Well, guess we're headed the same way then.
1535934154	Then why don't you join us? I would love the company.
1167784740	Sure, why not.
493207314	How about it, Sunshine? Do you mind my company?
458849405	Just keep your distance.
165232390	VO TRACK
712805849	Break out of the Cage
599043079	Isabelle was put in a cage. Fortunately, she has ways to get out of situations like this.
804209469	Reach the Vantage Point
837398733	Head up there and get yourself an overview of the situation.
657203406	Free the Gang
1519058110	The gang is in trouble. Help them out.
1258390362	Help Cooper
2033151969	Cooper is pinned down on the sinking steamer.
2103457548	Free Doc
37759921	Doc has avoided capture and is hiding somewhere in the hut.
1634996819	Free Kate
1973661711	Kate was captured and put in a cage. Find a key or pick the lock.
150633749	Free Hector
959242649	Hector was captured and put in a cage. Find a key or pick the lock.
1917575343	Escape
595109735	Get everyone to the horses and leave.
276503151	Kill the Ponchos
1238109013	Give Cooper some breathing room by killing the two ponchos shooting at him.
1980903253	Loose Rock
1563635315	This rock looks loose. A shame if it would fall onto someone.
1598776947	Lookout Stand
1259070992	This lookout tower is pretty high. What if someone took an axe to it...
997256851	Pile of Crates
1597562743	This pile of crates looks unstable. A shame if it would collapse over somebody's head.
1457455127	Kill the Patrol
711876426	Use multiple traps to kill all three guards at the same time.
1438130694	Get the Traps
439330376	Get two additional bear traps to kill the patrol.
1569638234	Bianca
2030125916	Pick up Bianca.
870301240	Camilla
567042909	Pick up Camilla.
750127793	Lucia
1778900323	Pick up Lucia.
82329080	Healing
828180189	Remember, healing is unlimited and only restricted by a cooldown.
1457086053	Advanced Connecting
1023629680	You can use Connect on your team members as well. All damage they receive is transferred.
1374244853	No Reinforcements
1732013177	If you set off an alarm there won't be reinforcements.
530771191	The banks of the mighty Mississippi. The river sees a thousand stories every day. Let's make this one entertaining. 
171319177	We all know how much Mr. Hector loves his little Bianca. One can only imagine what he could do with three of them.
199545376	Why not put it to the test. Take a look at the trio up there. I'm sure my clients would be delighted if you took them out all at once.
556228268	Of course, we are talking about bear trap kills. I took the liberty of removing all other means of offense from your roster.
172753097	Happy hunting, my friend. And remember: My clients are watching.
703840751	Well wasn't that a sight. But maybe it's for the best that there's only one, true Bianca.
1507855381	So you've been following this guy?
1501963814	Last we heard he was headed for New Orleans.
192433283	I've seen him. He works for the DeVitt Company.
1428101056	Don't know where he is, though. Sorry.
2142838867	We'll ask around. 
43510847	So, what's your plan now?
1242051853	I was supposed to meet up with Wayne, but I can't find him anywhere.
511639318	You think something happened to him?
1165235131	Could be. Think I better look for him.
136989762	Then count us in. We still owe you for your help back there.
1873580448	You don't owe me anything.
918226040	Hey fellas 
1652818583	You got everything you need?
513565066	Bianca's oiled up and ready for action.
1608044066	Well let's go and find Frank.
1076949057	What about Isabelle and her friend?
229128354	Listen...
1229627458	Why don't we split up?
1231336393	I'm pretty sure you can handle this on your own.
899842538	We'll meet here later, all right?
1464031914	Sure...
754289243	Let's go, Hector.
1699491377	See you later, ladies.
34392205	Well... 
1211196005	So what's going on here?
1137491574	We're looking for Isabelle's friend. Wanna join?
173864141	I won't hold it against you if you decline.
2056450478	Like I said before, I don't enjoy owing favors.
397429678	To be clear: We find your Wayne, that makes us even.
830699354	Try to lighten up, Sunshine. 
1652314598	You're in New Orleans.
2140280330	VO TRACK
146513349	Whatever. So any bright ideas how we find your Wayne? 
599156730	My gut tells me it's the DeVitt Company. Maybe they tried to get rid of him.
975977912	Makes sense. But how do we find out what happened?
1866657286	Hmm, let me think...
828060417	Wayne told me he was looking into three men connected to Devitt.
1350230044	Arthur McGain, district judge. Spends his nights at the Café Chez Manu.
1364286212	Raymond Irving, took over the Red Lantern after the previous owner disappeared.
1665672023	And Ted O'Neill, used to be a smuggler, now somehow got a job as foreman at Pier 9.
1840729988	I bet one of these fellas is involved. Probably carries a letter of instructions with him.
101243554	A letter, huh? So how do we know who's the culprit?
557427967	Good question. We should take a stroll through the quarter.
1809967679	Lots of DeVitt men there. If we keep our ears open, we might catch a few clues.
293872870	This is exciting. We should get a disguise too. Then we'll find our culprit in no time.
1127581865	Or we just pick through our targets until we get the one who has the letter.
985932825	Come on now, McCoy. I think a little investigation could be fun.
177290138	I wasn't put on this earth to have fun.
1934499197	We'll see. Now let's get a move on. Wayne's waiting.
1445125768	The market's lively tonight.
1164344156	Heh, market's busy as usual.
705833719	Let's keep going. We'd just waste time here.
2144361835	You never know, Sunshine. Might pay to listen in on a few conversations.
1584209694	What's going on back here?
314763280	What do we have here?
292395596	Let's just keep our heads down. I'd like to avoid unnecessary trouble.
672055057	Not much to see back here.
283554764	Why are we heading this way?
1249291922	Something's going on in that little courtyard. Might be worth a look.
923980230	Okay, heads down.
1191238407	Careful now.
1855107592	Let's find ourselves a good spot and listen in.
880438370	Oh, I know that smell.
1071451308	Smells like an opium den.
1715461989	The Dragon's Den. Sounds exciting. Let's have a look upstairs.
789067316	Fine. Just don't try the merchandise. It'll go to your head.
1342473463	Ugh... I feel dizzy.
1062804395	Told you it'd go to your head.
244970856	Let's grab the disguise and get out of this place.
1526696303	Oh hoh! Sweetie, you wear that thing with class.
1442340726	Why thank you, darlin'.
1076888900	You know your way around, Miss Moreau.
1306739217	Sure do. Spent a good part of my life in New Orleans.
642807447	Can't imagine living in a place like this.
1924424184	Oh, you get used to it, sweetie.
2094816434	Wonder how Cooper and Hector are doing.
1203587545	Getting into trouble most likely.
1439155848	You folks been together for long?
321905098	Just a few weeks. Feels much longer though.
1605814065	So where are you from?
369994905	Flagstone. Small mountain town west of Denver. 
811897958	What about you, Sunshine?
459413486	I don't recall that being any of your business.
876435598	What's happening over there?
283888378	What's going on over there?
1809123150	The company closed off that part of town. We shouldn't go in there until we know what we're looking for.
219469460	We come here together to deliver justice to Florence Smolker.
998537289	Yup, that's me. At yer service.
1995736946	Mr. Smolker is a man of many talents, which he chose to apply in his pursuit of petty and unlawful deeds.
1578733912	Ho hoh, now this is gonna be interesting.
165517694	Guilty of the theft, forgery, extortion, bribery, slander...
622937394	Heh, this is gonna take a while.
2091945035	Furthermore guilty of public offense, including walking through this very market fully nude.
610748151	He he, I remember that one.
230768875	Also guilty of defacing the walls of the district courthouse and several other public offices.
1562964936	Are we finished here? I got better things to do.
878827343	It appears Mr. Smolker wishes to proceed with his execution. Hangman... Where's the hangman?!
240168927	Maybe he overslept.
208998042	The exectution must be delayed until a hangman is present. Therefore, I shall reiterate the sentence.
849714549	Heh, here we go again.
1521147679	Hey! This is none of your business. Get lost!
1129627578	Shit. Why can't we be at the Chez Manu?
494204231	What the fuck! You wanna kiss the Jackal's ass?
276097611	N-n-no, no, no, but...the Chez Manu. Wonder what the food tastes like.
989491626	You idiot. Stay clear of the Jackal. Now shut up—I gotta think.
2110044982	Hey, it's the Red Lantern. What's there to think about?
688990229	I'm broke. And the Spider upped the prices again.
1353097532	Hah, you dumb broad! The company owns the Red Lantern now! Means we get a discount.
726914357	You say that. Not sure the Spider sees it that way.
1977251696	Yeah. Heard it's gonna go down at Pier 9. 
2053568799	Shit. The Hawk must be sweating bullets by now.
1961504817	The Hawk's a slave driver. I think he even sleeps at Pier 9.
358638545	Times sure are changing. Used to be he and I was touring bars together.
1890835691	"The Jackal." At the Chez Manu.
698279061	"The Jackal." At the Chez Manu.
241146415	"The Jackal." At the Chez Manu.
1189890684	"The Spider." At the Red Lantern.
1789887418	"The Spider." At the Red Lantern.
1976053532	"The Spider." At the Red Lantern.
62156202	"The Hawk." At Pier 9.
658358907	"The Hawk." At Pier 9.
2112717841	"The Hawk." At Pier 9.
2144548116	Guess they're using codenames.
116469683	How's "The Jackal" doing?
535718792	He's just drinking. Says he's waiting for orders.
1418858924	He didn't get the letter this time, so he's waiting for orders.
837665109	Good.
267296907	Tell me about "The Spider."
583428114	Business is good. Says he's gonna reach the next quota.
59054748	Wasn't his turn to get the letter. Business is good though.
1329417561	I'll pass it along. That's all.
317979344	"The Hawk." Tell me.
21810915	Still hard at work. Big day tomorrow.
155153336	No letter for him. He's got his hands full anyway. Big day tomorrow.
2051686385	He better deliver. That's all.
326455119	How's "The Jackal" doing?
1812596916	He got your instructions. Says Mr. Wayne is taken care of.
1904009637	That's good.
1664909010	Tell me about "The Spider."
938941370	He got your instructions. Says Mr. Wayne is taken care of.
1787437340	That's good.
943241867	"The Hawk." Tell me.
1696908126	He got your instructions. Says Mr. Wayne is taken care of.
821854147	That's good.
1317712413	Sounds like "The Jackal" ain't our man.
48220368	Which means "The Jackal" isn't our man.
1526442995	Guess "The Jackal" ain't our guy.
1615136001	Sounds like "The Spider" ain't our man.
1509969468	Which means "The Spider" isn't our man.
489966514	Guess "The Spider" ain't our guy.
686464143	Sounds like "The Hawk" ain't our man.
1706082026	Which means "The Hawk" isn't our man.
644986387	Guess "The Hawk" ain't our guy.
2101013785	Sounds like "The Jackal" is the one we're looking for.
2126909881	Which means "The Jackal" is the man we're looking for.
1453890450	Guess "The Jackal" is the guy we're looking for.
832160714	Sounds like "The Spider" is the one we're looking for.
645274602	Which means "The Spider" is the man we're looking for.
85546794	Guess "The Spider" is the guy we're looking for.
1969048349	Sounds like "The Hawk" is the one we're looking for.
154678638	Which means "The Hawk" is the man we're looking for.
336784378	Guess "The Hawk" is the guy we're looking for.
1969995004	Let's listen around the market. Maybe someone knows about the Jackal.
1365636844	Let's listen around the market. Maybe someone knows about the Spider.
1695671136	Let's listen around the market. Maybe someone knows about the Hawk.
225305279	So where do we stand?
13606027	Yeah... I think we can figure this out.
1864479743	Then let's pay our man a visit.
1541132013	That one looked important. We might have made a mistake.
1938327105	I think we just took out our informant. What a shame.
2462133	Shit. I think we just killed one of our leads.
2140900740	Whoops. I think we killed our informant again.
742463526	Well, there goes another informant. Shucks.
1132822121	Damn it! Won't learn nothing from this one either.
560160249	There goes the third.
539421398	You know at this rate, we might as well guess who our target is.
1966326887	You might have a point there, Sunshine.
1342781197	The Chez Manu.
810467092	The Chez Manu.
127484276	The Chez Manu.
1847650157	Not the kinda place they let folks like me in, if you get my meaning.
107600185	Anyway, looks like McGain has the place booked up tonight.
1285884194	That must be McGain.
273159847	So that's McGain.
1603112552	There's McGain.
57560143	The Red Lantern.
1771295977	The Red Lantern.
347908982	The Red Lantern.
2135074413	Fanciest whorehouse in the quarter. Girls there will make your dreams come true.
628126091	Though from what I hear, times are tough since Irving took over.
582098837	That must be Irving.
1245268098	So that's Irving.
715680263	There's Irving.
1368265650	That's Pier 9.
1548829488	That's Pier 9.
98314296	That's Pier 9.
8401912	I'm told there's a big DeVitt shipment scheduled for tomorrow.
1127584948	Guess that explains why Mr. O'Neill is still out and about.
1184918724	That must be O'Neill.
968141999	So that's O'Neill.
491318181	There's O'Neill.
629052053	If he's our guy, he should have a letter of instructions with him.
879618324	I can pick his pockets if you want.
906077924	Or we do this the old-fashioned way.
97201466	He he he *hic* that's right.
1871590909	I'm the judge, baby. *hic*
2084648243	More whiskey! *hic* Service!
59557854	Don't mess with me *hic* ya hear?
1962734986	DeVitt. Now that's a fine *hic* fine gentleman.
246183928	I'm gonna shake his hand. Yeah! *hic* I like that.
875344528	Keep the men in line. We have an important guest arriving tomorrow.
380638117	Yup.
1710193888	Uh huh.
1459170128	The man accepts only top-tier quality. Do you understand?
1137409414	Yup.
1093522855	Uh huh.
1888043888	Have you ever met the man, by the way?
1263120249	Nope.
126911552	Nuh uh.
1010387985	Just be on your best behavior. I'm sure it'll go over smoothly.
400158060	Yup.
834486489	Uh huh.
1022413456	You're not related by any chance, are you?
166412832	Brother.
1719691493	Sister.
1284347500	Never knew you were siblings. That explains so much.
1279156071	Yup.
49711119	Uh huh.
769170497	No, no, no, that ain't right! Damnit, use your head!
590231831	We gotta fix that before the boss shows up, got it?
1328189828	What kinda asshole wrote down these numbers? Fix it.
718126977	You better explain this to me before I go crazy!
253220439	Someone's gotta take care of this mess, you got me?
464338604	That's still not done. We gotta make the quota, understand?
463064814	I have something. Some sort of letter...
1098183291	All right... Another letter.
555689224	Got something here. Some kinda letter...
767169570	All right... Another letter.
1832489495	Got something. Looks like a letter...
990212413	All right... Another letter.
389411529	Let's see... "Dear Agnes, my heart burns for you, and my..." ...Oh my!
547770477	What's this... "Dear Agnes, my heart burns for you, and my..." What the hell!
664926887	All right... "Dear Agnes, my heart burns for you, and my..." Whoa!
832226714	I don't think we got the right letter.
2020516747	Right. Let's burn this and wash our eyes with soap.
352064117	All right... "Horse bridles, leather straps, pork fat, cucumbers..." What the!
1042598642	Let's see... "Horse bridles, leather straps, pork fat, cucumbers..."!
1966524943	Hmm... "Horse bridles, leather straps, pork fat, cucumbers..."
298308650	Is this a list of supplies?
1033885340	That's a strange shopping list.
1505977239	Definitely not what we're looking for.
469915095	Hmm... That's...not a letter.
609260196	All right...some illustration...!
1784579402	Let's see here... Some sorta sketch... Oh!
1888129761	Nice curves. Love the color. And the detail too.
1023048837	Charming as this is, it's not what we're looking for.
1913991251	A list... Instructions. And it mentions your friend Wayne.
1333072325	Looks like instructions. Mentions your friend Wayne.
1985481922	Some kind of list... Yes! It mentions Wayne by name.
1477183034	This is it! Nice work, everybody.
1187460674	Let's regroup. I wanna take a closer look.
297958742	All right, what do we have...
1590176834	Looks like the bastards kidnapped Wayne. Took him somewhere private.
792444059	There's an address here... Some storage yard. 
1799017065	Pretty close by actually. Just down the road, past these roadblocks.
1966029408	So we have to get through more DeVitt Company men. All right.
397094070	So that's the place. You think we'll find him there?
445038948	We have to.
1605672764	That shed there looks like an office. I got a feeling they're keeping him there.
1390377140	I'll pick the lock for you. After that, we're even.
1130895071	Let's get on with freeing your Wayne, provided he's still alive.
215966879	He better be. If they laid a finger on him, by God there'll be hell to pay.
1010561192	So he's really coming by tomorrow?
1317093524	Why do you think everyone here's shitting their pants?
88746304	Ah, so that's why...
1949360642	Any reason why he's coming now?
198457042	You hear what happened in Colorado?
1026469705	The Flagstone business? Oh yeah.
2117077330	How do I look? You think he'll notice me?
219174940	He better not. If he does, that's when you're in trouble, partner.
708043211	Oh, shit...
1237352316	Heh, this looks promising.
1402218786	We sure ain't welcome here.
264824954	I'm starting to wonder how deep this rabbit hole goes.
1584283256	Don't blame me, Sunshine.
1106473105	More guards down the street.
166424142	I see more of them down the street.
465289283	You're going to a lot of trouble to find this Wayne.
1400108595	What part of "friend" don't you understand, Sunshine?
1395639115	These DeVitt bastards are up to no good.
1559167070	Wonder what all the DeVitt men are doing here.
1314045123	So how you and this Wayne connect to all this?
1912928322	Like I said, we've been looking into folks disappearing.
1051106575	He got caught and you're risking your neck to drag him out.
1372638422	Hard for you to understand, I'm sure.
1384066380	Almost there. Just down the street.
31944297	Almost there. Just down the street.
2111191640	You're lucky we came along. You'd never have made this on your own.
1190377016	And if you didn't owe me, I guess I'd have to pay you now.
1938896468	Of course. In my experience, good Samaritans only do well in Bible stories.
2136802715	You know what? You're a real treat, Sunshine.
1871449115	This must be it.
299238872	I think we found it.
1413453238	DeVitt Company storage yard. Yeah, I'd say we're right here.
1447797586	Let's have a look, shall we?
1114882330	Well this ain't shady at all.
408350654	Well this is ominous.
1024511792	We're in. Don't see Wayne anywhere yet.
1023539256	Let's head for the office.
1353614439	Boy, am I glad that shipment's gone.
1853635034	Yeah. I could use some sleep.
1632449923	That one fella sure got on my nerves.
1807356780	Heard he's a special catch. Pissed off the company.
503605740	Frank sure got his hands full this week.
2097086786	Is it just me, or does he look old?
172821941	Wanna stop by the Dragon's Den later?
102938465	Sure. Only if you're paying.
938468677	Heard that O'Neill's putting the boys through the ringer.
1514509022	Glad we didn't get the harbor shift.
1309442366	Ever been to the Chez Manu?
1812567349	Are you courtin' me, Louie?
808863412	Why they call it the Queen's Nest anyway?
2005629159	No idea. Maybe they got wasps there or something.
2103171610	You know, sometimes it feels like we're being watched.
1455594738	You never stop talking, do you?
1630811472	What's under that tarp?
1664353329	What's under that tarp?
1252177924	What's under that tarp.
1259929839	Bunch of empty cages.
1352757938	Looks like they brought people through here. Shit.
1927222652	This must be the office.
2142681034	I see the office.
1214468340	There's the office.
1524391183	I'll let you in, but then my slate is clean.
410420010	You keep saying that, Sunshine.
1129445588	Looks like your friend ain't here.
1168794026	Shit. Where the hell are you, Wayne?
249802973	Maybe we'll find another clue here.
219140629	Hmm...think I found something... Another letter.
873332129	What's this... Another letter... Looks promising.
1249595933	What's that...another list of instructions, huh?
1677552956	Fine. Let's head back.
449474010	So what do we have?
1980407959	Something about a shipment. Looks like they brought Wayne out of the city.
1297036403	To the "Queen's Nest"!
570706827	What's that?
2035999352	Old place in the bayou. This can't be good.
310911371	So we're done here?
1454501434	McCoy!
1182921693	Nah, he's right. I got what I need. Time we head back.
352835152	Investigate Wayne's Disappearance

1898258470	Mhh...New Orleans. A city after my own heart. Some people here even remember my name. They do well not to forget.
1756528912	The man you see here goes by Louis the Hand. He's a gambler, you see, and a cheeky one. He doesn't know my name, which is why he tried to cheat me.
1357129663	A misguided act, but not something my clients let slide. They want a word with him. Be so kind and deliver him to my boat at Pier 9.
1589160504	Oh, and don't worry about keeping the man alive. Either way, it won't be a pleasant meeting for him.
1336350858	Best not forget that, my friend. My clients are always watching.
525315095	Ah, I see Mr. Louis is safely on board. Good work. My clients will be pleased.

726889046	Come on, Sunshine. Technically we still haven't found Wayne yet.
794767794	My slate is clean.
853016272	You want money, right? Wayne can pay you in spades.
1814242977	How much are we talking about?
1900965950	Well how much does a seasoned gun-for-hire go these days?
735007346	And how do I know all this ain't just talk.
63736693	You'd know a bluff when you see one, right Sunshine?
1537679916	My, look at you two.
637499074	Just a business agreement.
1645316606	Don't worry, we're gonna find Wayne soon.
1191059120	Yeah.
1529350450	Thanks again.
1405998789	Hello ladies.
1767901328	Howdy.
1751712070	Finally. Any news about Frank?
604259569	Ah, we just kicked up some dust.
480260808	And?
16045425	Looks like something big is going down here soon.
714800923	And Frank's gonna be in the middle of it.
1254625748	All we gotta do is wait for him to show up.
510442306	And you? Any luck finding your Wayne?
592739093	They brought him to a secret place in the bayou.
1327266590	I sure could use some help getting him out of there.
1206896571	Unless you wanna leave all the fun to me and Sunshine.
1528463808	The swamps, huh? How come you're on board, Doc?
371658829	I was promised proper compensation.
1737140275	What do you say, amigo?
554453436	All right. 
1401730595	But one of us should stay behind and try to find out more.
928787085	You can leave that to me.
347154777	Great, let's get going.
63572737	It's almost over.
744276640	Let's hope so.
1760714323	Kate.
314368980	Just one thing.
1836841578	You see Frank... 
747524990	...stay the hell away from him.
1636053587	Yeah sure.
1618556394	VO TRACK
530999012	We're almost there. And there's the welcoming committee.
391549281	Hey, it's no fun if they don't put a few fellas in your way.
560262577	Oh, you call that a few? Who taught you how to count?
230156137	I did. There, that must be the entrance to the Queen's Nest. 
1729662051	We won't get through there without the others.
987727232	Then we better hope the others didn't get lost.
923629017	See the guards? This has to be it.
1636836732	About time. This swamp is foul.
577485680	Let's make our way through and meet the others inside.
1583145713	So Belle, where do you think they're keeping your friend?
68532589	I bet Wayne's in one of those cages. We'll open them all until we find him.
1509161406	We're gonna need McCoy to pick the locks.
2130325518	And after we free your Wayne?
1919762542	We're gonna burn down that steamboat. Put them out of business.
2056886389	How, you reckon?
835921626	First we smash that oil barrel on the roof.
1628167094	Sounds like a job for the axe.
1763541953	Right. And when the oil spills out, we grab a little torch.
1106934862	We light it up and then we run.
295892134	Heh, I like it. But, how do we get away?
1377308491	We'll snatch one of them boats down on that pier and head back to the city.
487083302	Sounds like a plan.
2034311477	All right. We go in, get Wayne, set fire to the whole mess and get the hell outta here.
973473391	Here we go.
1079709068	Gotta be careful around here. If you walk through shallow water, you're gonna make noise.
349939198	Uh sure.
348731245	And don't forget the mud. You're gonna leave footprints.
2048014237	I hate swamps.
195707661	All right, this way.
779454957	Let's get moving. I wanna be inside before McCoy gets there.
515244566	You two making bets now or something?
118011838	No, I just wanna see the look on his face.
967276896	Makin' progress. We're gonna be first.
1303117509	What's your beef with Doc. He's not so bad.
1352835939	I don't like his attitude. He'd do anything for the right price. 
301921037	Reminds me way too much of someone I once knew.
201567580	There's the way in.  Wayne's gotta be inside.
9762025	That Wayne must be a good friend if you're goin' to all this trouble.
1537149592	There was a time when I'd have done anything for money. I mean anything!
870743775	Wayne pulled me outta that hole. I owe him.
1950692778	Ahh! Nothing like good ol' Magull Whiskey.
1422168245	Hey! Leave some for us, will ya?
1958744351	Bastard drank it all, he he he.
2078299011	I'm gonna have me some fun with that Wayne fella.
1509218974	Heard he's a marshal or something like that.
1969518147	Not anymore he ain't, he he he.
941523875	You think DeVitt's coming here?
464502605	Nah. Rich folk like him don't get their shoes dirty.
1202578248	Ain't no clean shoes around here, he he he.
1813814268	Don't think I've ever seen you sober, Lawrence.
1667671119	Bullshit. He just got hit in the head, that's all.
356011784	He he he he he he he he he.
1008994962	Better keep our heads down.
394342275	Isabelle mentioned that creek. Must be on the right track.
1942497857	I'd say the abundance of guards is a dead giveaway.
414612662	Let's get moving. I'd like to be there first.
1966048323	I get the impression you don't like Isabelle very much.
1887668967	I think the feeling's mutual. 
1768172355	Well, glad you're still helping out.
1742429876	This is just business. 
1715622344	Think I see the wall over there.
144811573	She's going through a lot of trouble to rescue this Wayne. This is something personal.
714123754	When things get personal, the wrong people usually end up dead. That's why I keep it simple.
409515846	Mhm.
1375335870	Let's get the cages open.
1618727316	Let's get the cages open.
566432768	You know, I thought we got rid of slavery a while back.
547737395	That's why they call it "convict leasing" now.
2016914504	What's that supposed to be?
1291492756	Say the DeVitt Company pick you off the road and get you convicted for vagrancy. 
239733619	As a convict, they lease you out to the highest bidder until you work off your sentence.
1659475668	Sounds just like slavery to me.
1728484103	The difference is negligible.
2083170775	This place gives me the willies.
594152490	Yup. Sure glad we got those walls around the Nest.
202155042	Wouldn't wanna spend a night out here.
1454660690	That makes two of us.
996639398	You hear about old Earl? Poor guy who fell off a boat?
2114955412	What about him?
747483830	Splashed in the water. Never came back up. No blood, no nothing.
2087442948	Strange. Earl's a good swimmer.
305838969	You know what? I think the swamp witches took him.
445767501	Like the ones that came to Baton Rouge?
371577210	Uh huh. Maybe they're taking people. Capturing them for some sinister purpose.
476853523	They ain't getting me without a fight!
1615479233	Easy as pie.
660148769	Heh, we're in.
1543987577	Well, I don't see the others. Means we got here first.
238910278	Or maybe they DID get lost.
1230300097	Finally.
1596514092	Okay, we're in.
1341400201	Looks like we made it here first.
1216673648	Maybe they ran into trouble.
1053210360	There they are.
255975754	Hah, it's them.
1144857004	Hey there, fellas.
1547221140	Look who's here.
1306748513	What took you so long?
554557884	You still out here?
1079425902	Didn't know this was a race.
857683934	Yeah I missed you too, Sunshine.
1866457909	You sure took your sweet time.
256514254	You two still out here?
1477069799	Excuse me, we took the hard way!
210017879	Yeah, and also the shorter.
118707927	That's a lot of people they've caged here.
1500034521	So we open the cages until we find your friend.
265717227	There's the cages. Good thing I packed a spare set of lockpicks.
476624086	Wayne's gotta be in one of those cages. We'll just have to go through them all.
1884905362	Aww, look at you. You scared? You should be.
1371063274	You ever swing a pickaxe? Well, you'll get used to it.
1826335791	Don't worry. There'll be lots of opportunity to apply yourselves.
415611479	Maybe they'll send you northwest. Heard they got a bridge to rebuild.
475557256	Welcome to the DeVitt Company, ladies and gents, he he.
2063499326	Thanks, stranger.
1251041711	Yes. Is there a man named Wayne in here?
1494454137	Uh, don't think so.
1405948237	Never mind.
1676285114	Wait until the coast is clear, then run for the swamp.
781402605	Heaven must have sent you.
318311583	I doubt that. Does anyone here go by the name of Wayne?
304756772	Wayne? Not that I know.
400518916	It figures.
1452111030	Wait here. Leave when the coast is clear.
1196846099	Well, you're a sight for sore eyes, stranger. Marshal Wayne, at your service.
1192149446	There's a voodoo woman looking for you.
160627544	Wait, did you say "Marshal"?!
1119181442	I sure did, friend. Let's get outta here.
1677647722	Hope you've some luck left in you, Marshal. We'll wait until it's safe to run.
23696602	Isabelle!
537540583	Wayne! You look like something the cat drug in!
1653558980	I knew you wouldn't leave me to rot. Let's get out of here.
1045505533	Heh, you betcha.
421858296	That's the last of 'em.
1234617061	You did good, friend. Those people will always remember you.
553760005	Not sure that's something I want.
1884614326	Sorry to be a burden. I'm without a gun.
414793650	Long as you can keep up, that's fine.
1556384979	If you don't need it right now, you could lend me that Buntline.
1837007047	If I take a bullet to the head, it's yours. Else it stays with me.
2015781415	The River Queen. Must have been a beauty in her day.
1387989918	That's one beautiful steamboat. How did she get stuck out here?
422182605	If this is the Queen's Nest, guess that makes her the Queen.
1550681455	The River Queen, huh?
2054753324	That's a lot of old wood. Just needs some oil and a nice, flaming torch.
1264776285	I agree. Let's send that bitch to hell where it belongs.
1297900288	...!
388686307	That does it for the oil.
1234981256	Good. Now let's get ourselves some fire.
391215177	Look at it go!
14184608	I'd call that a Louisiana barbecue.
1947094530	That fire won't go out for a while.
334527012	Justice is served.
1097581157	There's a sight to warm an old heart.
1848331215	Now we just gotta get Wayne.
2029422069	Holy hell! The Queen's on fire!
879665245	The Queen's burning!
1691191266	Fetch some water, goddamnit.
1651797763	Where do we get water?
984070505	It's a damn swamp, you moron!
1952535104	Get moving!
1146180855	I think we're done here. Let's get a boat.
40099435	Let's get out of here.
1013386272	I'm right behind you.
1177725420	...Wait... That smell.
861634660	That whiskey! It's been years...
1660271882	Magull Whiskey! Oho, come to Hector.
196742734	Hmm...
549644638	Shame we have to leave the barrel here.
1223509762	Looks like we all made it.
1084459754	Heh, look at that thing burn.
1866910761	Was about time someone took this place down. Those bastards can burn in hell.
1886773831	Let's head back to the city. I've had enough swamp for one day.
1800566241	You're right. Back to New Orleans.
503426413	Find Wayne
672030005	Wayne is locked up in one of those cages. Crack the locks with Doc and find him.
996230318	Cage A
1377345476	Look for Wayne in here.
1681441679	Cage B
1448160974	Look for Wayne in here.
880926010	Cage C
910307213	Look for Wayne in here.
1767642942	Set the Queen on Fire
1711852069	The River Queen is the older steamer that functions as the heart of the base. Burn it to the ground.
1869799317	Crack the Oil Barrel
1699007547	Crack open the oil barrel with Hector's axe.
436269072	Grab a Torch
313231754	After you've spilled the oil, grab a torch from the bonfire and light it up.
166841736	Escape
1604341002	Get Wayne and the others to the boat so you can escape.
1378508936	Torches and Oil
361164267	You can pick up torches at bonfires and carry them around. Throw them to ignite areas covered in oil.
216101306	Wayne
1976141749	You found Wayne. Make sure he stays alive.
788724665	Seems like things have gone from bad to worse here.
787748742	Well that's no surprise after our little campfire in the bayou.
2020914219	Now Frank knows we're coming.
144105785	Son...
734548261	I really don't think it's a good idea to go after him now.
1204234648	With all due respect Marshal, that's none of your business.
1035161825	Why not wait until things calm down?
91022030	Yeah. Set up a proper plan.
408664922	It's fine. Hector and I can handle this.
647570020	Hey there, fellas!
1331179360	Hey Kate. Did our sunshine find you alright?
1157283445	Don't tell me you had any doubts.
310260247	You must be Wayne. Kate O'Hara.
753076254	Marshal Wayne, at your service.
2106651962	Marshal?!
26992097	How come you never told us, Isabelle?
1868225304	Well he wasn't a marshal the first time we met.
524697879	Anyways, I'd say we better get things going now.
1755033369	I owe you all a great deal, gentlemen. 
1826222432	I really hope I'll be able to repay the favor someday.
172605929	Oh you can repay me right now, Marshal.
2101720186	Beg your pardon?
1033720154	Well...think I better clear this up.
998730654	Good luck, Cooper.
1226876160	What are you doing?
59166717	You think I'm gonna let you go alone?
9606538	You should go with them.
1200174825	I'd rather come with you if that's all right.
252754292	Suit yourself.
1158997095	VO TRACK
266443030	All right. So where's Frank?
1268483996	Down at the harbor, Pier 9. 
1833083206	Whatever's going on there, he's handling it.
577818914	Then that's where we gotta be. Let's meet up at the gate.
1586362491	Lots of patrols out on the streets.
314533104	There sure are. But I lost my disguise.
96392486	What happened?
417453428	Let's just say I still got a few things to learn about poker.
57838474	Anyway, I think I can find a new one at the brothel.
1829053166	Anyway, I think I can find a new one at the Red Lantern.
179603340	We can stop by on the way to the pier.
407267459	All right. Let's get moving before Frank skedaddles again.
1293480776	...! ...! ...! Hey!
1154784819	What did I miss?
1648054498	Just the plan. I'll fill you in on the way.
345719109	Right. Ready for action.
1424107471	Let's avoid the blockade.
921127699	We better stay clear of that checkpoint.
837549036	They're not joking about the lockdown.
1241250391	Frank must be nervous about something.
255654356	Means Frank's getting nervous. That's good.
1366938416	More DeVitt men ahead.
180571989	Oh, I see lots of work for Bianca.
194022756	Careful. There's checkpoints everywhere.
352018647	How do we get past them?
1245413102	There's more cover at the market. I'd go through there.
2034006796	So they are still loose? Is there any danger?
572142553	I'm afraid so. I must ask you to stay behind the barrier.
2130247634	Did you hear that, Howard? How exciting.
12701244	Who are these criminals?
1912110629	They assaulted an upstanding citizen. But we'll get them.
710461841	I bet it was them colored folks next door. 
1312556794	How come you're here and not the sheriff?
1888041617	I work for Mr. DeVitt, sir. But we're helping out with the law enforcement.
2053058130	DeVitt's such a fine man. Always caring for the community.
1275055805	I heard Mr. DeVitt was coming here. Has he arrived yet?
479044658	I couldn't tell you, sir. I'm not familiar with his schedule.
1807467019	Oh, he must be a busy man.
28630119	Well, I hope you catch the bastards.
1652285002	We hope so too, sir. Now, will you head home promptly?
404404980	Nonsense, my dear. We wouldn't miss this for the world.
1507779349	Let's go over this again. What did the man look like?
1477480309	Come on, Freddy. I told you all that already.
423571518	Did I stutter? What did the man look like?!
1080214708	Uh, brown coat, dirty jeans? You know, the normal.
1624069901	So he came asking for Frank. What did you tell him?
234355698	You think I'm a loud mouth? I told him to go to hell.
1996325731	Now why don't I believe you?
1010721157	He beat me senseless, man! What more do you want!
1699045499	Anything else? Think real hard.
1229887837	He carried two guns. One looked old, the other pretty new.
1367700055	Frank's not gonna be happy about this.
1626019556	I told him what I told you. For damn sake.
1986795261	That's that.
1563044379	Through here.
778651497	Straight through the checkpoint. A bit bold, don't you think?
114443374	It worked. Now come on—Frank's waiting.
1128538110	Halfway there.
1489257316	Uh, where now?
430255386	Why not stop by the Red Lantern? I could really use a disguise.
1832326260	Doesn't matter. All roads lead to the harbor.
1149630617	All right. There's the whorehouse.
1764674115	Hmm, there's the whorehouse.
1815809576	Looks like the Red Lantern is closed for today.
1893706550	Whatever. Let's be quick here.
1532694153	Heh, this place reminds me of the one in Deadwood.
2047439447	Not now Hector.
1273162532	How long is this going to take! We have reservations for today!
1352318700	Heh, like I said. Place is locked down due to the investigation.
2057685011	This is preposterous! You just want the place to yourself!
903071688	We have been waiting for over an hour. Can't you hurry it up?
131639378	We're just making sure we, uh, investigate all possible angles.
1922022234	And I'll make sure I file a lengthy complaint with Mr. Irving.
1405781978	Still "questioning" the girls?! Do you take me for a fool, sir?
1034219066	Heh, no sir. I take you for a gentleman, with lots of patience.
1672081835	Patience?! We're getting soaked out here, you impudent brute!
823446862	Open the damn gate! We are thirsty and in need of company!
472052624	Sorry sir. At least you'll have each other while you wait.
490607596	The gall! Don't you dare walk back through those doors!
1442311527	They are getting angry out there.
39632712	Maybe you should tell your studs to hurry up their "investigation."
2094441960	We got time. Why not have some fun...
704498306	Look honey, we're getting paid by your boss. Doesn't make us friends.
2021559530	Look at those idiots out there, ha ha.
1443684589	Those idiots pay full price. Unlike you DeVitt boys.
1700851674	Come on, sweetie. I can even pay extra.
1454563349	Why don't you finish your "investigation" first. Then we can talk.
267095627	Maybe we overdid it here.
1114932424	Nah. It's good! Ain't no one getting through here.
399338843	Yeah, but who's gonna clean this up later?
1051223816	Not me, that's for sure.
405274239	My my...
2094576614	Look at all this junk.
1823804974	Guess not all roads lead to the harbor.
440601529	I got what I need.
1871149542	Then let's move it.
851670999	This way.
1818043732	This way, amigo.
423452625	The harbor ain't far now. Just down the street.
2110783539	The harbor ain't far now. Just through the alley.
32736333	Guess your chase will be over soon.
1261584198	Mhm.
1853430813	Look ahead.
1181533852	I smell the river.
361861253	See the fence? That's the harbor.
1724359099	You've been pretty quiet lately.
1538141028	Just thinking. Don't worry.
1993344264	Can I board my coach now, ma'am? I'm soaked.
129710443	Afraid not. We gotta search everything thora...thorlow...
63074807	Thoroughly?
138876612	Yeah, that's the word.
115078417	I don't understand what you want from me.
981411702	It's not about what I want. It's about what YOU want.
616559700	Me? You stopped my coach!
80702425	Uh, no! Damn, messed that one up.
1152265814	Are you drunk, ma'am?
1980030479	Yup. Drunk as a skunk, he he. Got a problem with that?
2078706220	I can't believe you're working for the sheriff.
585620394	Oh you better believe it partner. We got aaall the papers.
1321738850	Bastards just picked the lock to the office.
1229352555	Bet Frank wasn't happy about that.
1533530238	Right. But ain't he overreacting a little?
968644808	Well, you never know what's going on in his head.
1598804511	All right. We're at the harbor.
1468679126	Ah, this is the harbor.
1167952505	Not far now. We'll get him, Cooper. Don't worry.
1565595358	Don't get cocky. We still got a ways to go.
885220465	We've been through worse, haven't we?
312617706	You can never be sure.
1726825296	Almost there.
1556929191	We're almost there, amigo.
1555000561	You never told me what happened between you and Frank.
83081385	It's a long story.
463462753	It usually is.
1860391705	I'll tell you when we're done, okay?
1562553822	There's still smoke over the swamp.
3072081	Who gives a shit. We're still standing out here in the rain.
1903911585	You wanna complain, take it to Frank. 
264435687	Yeah right. Have you seen his mood lately?
1959853890	Think they're gonna come back here?
755971848	If so, they better do it fast. I wanna get out of this rain.
427139078	Careful what you wish for. I hear they're dangerous.
1433012591	I'd rather be in a gunfight than this damn rain.
1075732644	You heard what Frank did to poor Lewis?
714126194	We ain't supposed to talk about that.
1806619748	I mean, the man was dumb as a brick, but still...
593162373	Frank's been strange lately. Maybe he's finally losing it.
843777318	Careful. Frank said they might come here after what happened in the Nest.
1366766968	Got it, boss. I'll keep my eyes peeled.
246484724	There is a big fella with them. Watch out for 'im—I heard he's tough.
1011762172	All right, I'll be careful.
355407443	Eyes open! Frank said they might try to get through here.
1147105472	Okay! I'll stay right here.
1459970057	Stay alert! These guys are causing a whole lot of trouble.
839411700	I'll keep my eyes open.
1756631365	Last we saw of them was at the Nest. Frank says they might come here. 
2019980298	Oh, I hope they do, he he.
1435054417	Stay vigilant! Who knows what these assholes are up to.
1871452352	Got it under control, boss.
1627958694	Pier 9 is just around the corner.
163337462	There's the harbor. What was the number again...
396578546	Remember: We all meet at the gate on Pier 9. Nobody goes in alone.
1239364360	No problem, Cooper.
1461662265	Sure thing, amigo.
1592874094	Here we are. Pier 9.
1971851449	Open sesame, he he.
251973098	Qual o plano agora?
471402247	I'm going in alone.
1299927685	Like hell you are, Cooper.
142722208	You know how it's gotta be.
1763287543	Not this time, Cooper.
1740614320	What's going on here?
134435750	Out of my way, Hector.
43231532	Stop it, both of you!
1901925498	Listen to me, amigo.
1045394329	If you go in there alone, you're just gonna end up like your pa...
858015093	Hector!
816542941	What the hell?!
15435487	What the fuck is wrong with you, Cooper?
1042226063	You should find a place to hide.
1586046057	Damn you.
204539558	VO TRACK
1109648303	Are we sure this is gonna work?
2046392709	The boss is usually right. Stay calm and do your job.
1119489170	Big shipment this time. What is all this stuff?
381651621	None of our business. We just stand guard. That's all.
794947815	Could have sworn I heard a gunshot.
1699866449	Calm down. It's just the rain making you nervous.
2076189073	Goddamnit, this waiting's killing me.
23012361	Hey, at least you got shelter. I gotta stand out here.
656508474	Man, the boss is gonna flip when he sees this.
686673691	Yeah, but don't bother Frank with it. He's having his quiet time.
762279672	I can't pull that thing back on my own. You gotta tell Frank.
321174819	Trust me, buddy. You don't wanna bring this up with him right now.
300423727	Look, it won't move. Can you maybe give me a hand here?
61241591	Ha! No way. You made the mess, you gonna fix it.
70587762	You sure you don't wanna help? The boss is gonna be here soon.
1011506189	Ain't my head on the chopping block, so you better hurry.
1797514472	No.
1917057043	Not the right way.
1760949520	Not like this.
1098764162	Quiet down, will ya.
1953084981	I'm trying to smoke here.
1609886027	You havin' fun back there?
954257301	Hello Frank.
224421558	You’ve grown, kid.
196362913	A bit skinnier than your father, but overall not bad...
1351876617	How long’s it been? Ten years? Fifteen?
2051399708	You're just getting old.
326573527	...Maybe.
1648785514	Wonder what he would say.
346461861	You living on dirt and blood, making a name for yourself...
1049010232	Just like us back in the day.
1161837714	Are you done? Cause I ain't got all day.
59352447	All right kid...
1689389748	Let's see how far you've come.
1856970436	VO TRACK
2115571404	Gnh...
632140661	You're fast, kid.
987480715	Just like your father.
2096777083	That's enough!
1454144765	Frank! I see you're indulging yourself in old habits.
924815410	Kinda surprised to see you here, DeVitt.
1561106598	Well, I have to oversee my investments.
609407692	And this man cause me quite the trouble lately.
1128086836	...So you must be the rich asshole.
822621	Adorable.
845007003	What about the others?
769165645	Four captured. Marshal got away.
1814878794	Got away?
872656828	We'll get him. Don't worry, sir.
1463726551	Fine, off you go then.
1639818221	I really don't envy you, having to mingle with trash like this.
1141387201	Oh it ain't so bad. But I doubt you'd understand.
1303454431	I don't have to.
1666716055	That's what I have you for, after all.
1352388126	Right.
1330111570	So what's gonna happen to the kid now?
1711981189	We can't let good material go to waste.
1683647250	He's gonna work himself to death in the mines.
710916016	Together with his friends.
1535498807	You piece of shit...
1405023782	...argh...
528193204	VO TRACK
660651684	Reach Pier 9
105618621	Gather everyone at the gate of Pier 9.
708988117	Face Frank
1295369277	It's now or never. Head for the bow and face your destiny.
1937582108	Disguise
864823784	Kate lost her disguise while you were gone, but she can find a spare at the Red Lantern.
1554793200	Too bad, kid. Looks like you two ain't going home today.
1390422920	He's just a kid, Frank.
1968294381	Huh...
375900236	You wanna tell me what to do?
503009039	No...
1699198032	Good.
1678548162	Didn't think so.
927477867	Throw them down the canyon when you're done.
972936722	Boy.
1836426505	What's your name amigo?
1162383724	John...
963361016	I'm Hector.
718244975	VO TRACK
1124817653	Hrm...
1518677183	Shoulder still pain you?
723975603	Bah. Just stings a little is all.
412202818	But if I don't get out of here soon...
1788194199	...I'm gonna kill someone.
1980473239	Keep it together. We'll wait until the next break.
411261535	Gotta say, this plan of yours is pretty wild.
397717578	Didn't hear any better suggestions from you.
718915319	What about the dynamite?
962328600	I improvised.
134545727	What's that supposed to mean?
1785411874	I'll explain in a second.
1383298195	Just to be safe, can you go over the plan one more time?
1914360102	Jesus Christ...
1387381225	VO TRACK
682609609	Fine. First we fetch our belongings.
622664446	They're in those boxes in the upper camp.
2069419911	Next, I'll crack the lock on that gate so we can get out.
83151862	Once we're out, we'll get the dynamite.
982644464	Uh right. It's in that minecart. And it's not really dynamite.
402154637	What are you talking about?!
148836862	I couldn't get dynamite, so I filled a minecart with gunpowder.
81531990	You telling me we have to drag a minecart all the way to the gate.
1876785264	Hey. It's easy. We just light it up and boom, heh heh.
769820168	This is why I don't work with amateurs.
1079857917	Let's not forget about Kate and Cooper. 
685322981	Right. They put them together in those cages.
254165553	You sure you wanna help out that jackass?
2124535496	I'm not gonna leave Cooper behind.
712071934	I don't care either way.
1257884965	All right ladies, break time. Best make sure you freshen up for the next shift, heh heh.
2044414984	Okay, that's our cue. Don't screw this up now.
1746633762	About time.
142070457	Damn, I'm tired.
1301970097	Thanks again for stitching me up. You two make a good team.
1901138926	Is that right?
1112127556	You're welcome, Hector.
1828505974	That's one hell of a lock. 
654581953	Locked. Why wouldn't it be.
44168461	I'm gonna need my lockpicks.
27612010	If they refuse to work, shoot one of 'em. There's always more coming.
539013740	Yeah but there might be trouble a comin'. Some marshal got his ear to the ground.
1648501021	So? What's the law gonna do out here?
62545439	But if they found this place?
895602896	Then we'd put 'em to work too, hah hah! Now gimme that bottle!
742778618	What do you say, Doc? We going in?
1973847347	You wanna waltz right through the front door?
380420779	There are other ways to get in.
460242170	All right, I'm in. Try not to make any noise.
1698589942	Let's keep it quiet.
1138515417	Made it. Now, need to do this right.
320200121	Glad you're still with us, sweetie pie.
1859915880	*meows proudly*
171464383	The big guy? You takin' me for a fool?
1439672168	Fucker made the trip with a shoulder full of lead.
849787582	That's hogwash.
1666976715	They also say the cowboy was the one who shot him.
702008517	That damn rattlesnake. You know why they put him in a cage, right?
602685612	Bianca! I sure missed ya, girl.
1036057740	Looks like all is in order.
213539764	There we are... Few leaves still fresh enough.
1761626187	What about Cooper and Kate's belongings?
2037177346	In my bag.
872089983	Now the miner's cart.
282395675	Lunchtime I guess.
925958440	...Mmh, beans.
583741473	I sure could use a hot meal, right about now.
1066933449	We ain't got the time. 
147356723	One cart, just like the doctor ordered.
486357128	Hey Doc, there's the cart.
1592873871	Either of us can push the cart.
1144938845	Good to know.
1716104162	We still need the minecart.
929155596	Hey, don't forget the cart.
241452100	Hey, what about the minecart?
933936963	UhHrg... Here we go.
1162401160	UhHrg... Light cart, he says.
1992285649	Hrm... Heh, easy.
304649958	Now...now whatta we do?
880749737	What we gonna do now?
906973344	We gotta switch tracks. Use the levers.
16619315	There we go.
1056984587	That works.
751886073	Next stop, Cooper and Kate.
1705464109	Whatever.
737916266	The stream.
1149090533	Ah, the stream.
490839473	Bastards had me panning gold here.
257591643	You can thank Cooper for that.
1995265388	The coal mine.
1732852213	Through the coal mine, huh?
349144287	Bah... This is the last cart I'm pushing through here.
889883823	Still better than panning for gold in the river.
1740639474	Keep at it.
1659033132	Forward ho.
1496730585	We still got a ways to go.
364715046	Pull yourself together.
105590931	Always the sweetheart, Sunshine...
1957716404	We are making good time.
992856966	Never thought we'd get this far.
1955750412	We're not done here. Hurry it up.
1164112676	I can't wait to leave this all behind.
853281247	That makes two of us.
1701080708	The quarry.
1203525766	There's the quarry.
105902143	Poor fellas. Wonder where they're all from.
1955909627	That doesn't concern me.
303214725	What the hell is wrong with you, McCoy?
2120924583	All that matters is getting out of here.
931207961	I miss home.
410687283	Agh, my back.
2042784179	I'm so thirsty.
1214247506	I can't take it anymore.
73144754	So tired.
974745439	I shouldn't be here.
2006975240	Bastards.
1562693169	So hungry.
991631486	It ain't fair.
230285399	I don't wanna be whipped.
298285414	I'm dizzy.
847466416	It never ends.
601174856	Damn the DeVitt Company.
1496956927	Thank you kindly, stranger.
756661453	Just stay out of my way.
1810550559	Hide. Wait for the boom. Then run.
788094147	We're gonna blow up the gate. Wait here until then.
292568247	Got it.
528986580	There's Cooper and Kate.
159653377	I can see the others.
1081918118	There're the cages.
1946844100	I'll pick the locks.
513353119	If you have something to say, then say it.
1408733202	I've got nothing worth saying at this point.
1374245676	That's what you get for misbehaving.
900880699	Feeling cozy in there?
978215797	I'm surprised you're letting me out.
795095938	Take your stuff.
402906484	Sure. Thanks.
123389086	McCoy. Get me out of here.
314588434	These are yours I believe.
1361774041	Let's get out of here. I've had enough of this place.
880777560	Hector.
174451128	Cooper.
1799230920	We'll have a talk, later.
351677477	You bet.
846142708	Hgn...damn.
1826544707	I'm gonna have to take it slow.
245698559	Então, qual o plano?
349376903	You shut up and let the wiser amongst us figure that out.
1193466608	Yeah...I had that comin'. I'll keep up.
526041900	Huh...
1150084086	Uh...
318572992	There's more dynamite in that barrel.
1914256320	You telling me we don't need the cart?
895806806	We still need the cart. But it might help clear the way.
257922434	That's the spot.
1369993607	Finally...
148106665	I'll take the shot.
605008668	We still need to get Cooper and Kate out.
87181883	Wait. We need the others.
294584919	No. Let's get the others first.
1710937578	Not yet. The others are still locked up.
1586099081	All right, let's get out!
1302353218	*yawns*
1481639880	Hmph!
1641689256	Easy, friend.
815690801	Which way to the next train station?
1520189872	...Down the road...couple miles...
1444952461	Hmph!
757917807	Thank you.
1469280115	You never stand still, do you, Sunshine?
414423421	Well he's in a bad mood.
170833790	Can't really blame him.
398258641	We got out alive, didn't we?
1464183184	Yeah... Great...
2067100331	All right amigo, let's take a break.
140528692	Maybe we all could use a little break right now.
2137458313	Figured as much.
228112047	What are you up to?
140857790	No offense...
1512706557	...but I think I'm gonna cut my losses.
146657652	You gotta be kidding me!
1643751326	After all the shit we've been through?
267919344	That's right.
736689095	And whose fault is that, huh?
1697823096	Well well...
169205430	And here I thought you had a shred of decency in you, McCoy.
1110419048	I thought you'd know better by now.
730467693	VO TRACK
1953153072	Recover Your Gear
2013642566	Your tools are being kept in the upper camp. Prisoners are not allowed up there.
8469579	Hector's Gear
1153542495	Grab Hector's gear from the crate.
712349743	Doc's Gear
704782047	Grab Doc's gear from the crate.
789078812	Isabelle's Gear
267005513	Grab Isabelle's gear from the crate.
1347083076	Free the Others
2008741532	Cooper and Kate have been put into cages. Crack the locks with Doc and free them.
1199039024	Free Cooper
472209626	Use Doc to crack the lock of Cooper's cage.
1035068155	Free Kate
115075245	Use Doc to crack the lock of Kate's cage.
1538004971	Blow Up the Main Gate
1142209649	Get the mine cart in front of the main gate and blow it up.
468192995	Push the Mine Cart
985713034	Push the mine cart until you reach the main gate.
913558866	Get the Mine Cart
230899577	Hector has filled a mine cart with gunpowder. You will need it to blow your way out.
1454500394	The whole place is crawling with DeVitt men.
353737539	They must have signaled ahead.
881422973	Hah. So, what now?
312383462	I'm gonna have a look at the station.
443807117	You can't go down there alone.
49673994	That's grand advice coming from you.
1966751667	...Shit... 
2123009360	I'll help her.
1184118288	You stay put.
1227497301	Thanks, partner.
1961560632	Let me have a look at that leg. 
620830554	Gnah...
1454863047	Hector’s going pretty easy on you.
1430399952	We're old friends.
502689933	Weird friendship if you ask me.
2084580164	Gah! Shit!
2014953396	He knows how it is.
1616148156	No use dragging anyone else into my problems.
401213547	Especially not her...
337040815	...Gnah...
670873602	You know...
608753376	...no matter how many times I've heard that kinda bullshit...
991958001	...it never turned out right.
1818908759	ARGH!!!
957506317	You sure this is helping?
811291948	Just setting the bone.
681930907	Okay, but now wha...
1290480501	...hmph!
1800396173	Just lay down for a while.
1057051765	...Mh...
410121482	VO TRACK
273736257	Hey Kate!
692945523	Come on. Wait for old Hector.
96673601	So how's it look?
1915909382	Not so good. Watch.
178729337	Here comes the train.
969856639	Hey, why isn't it stopping?
1894833642	They must have orders not to.
1699942712	If we want a ride, we'll have to figure something out.
1782148420	Right. Uh...any bright ideas?
2110073007	Well...
740678377	We could drive cattle onto the tracks. That would stop the train.
916920895	How do we do that?
1271533937	We could scare them, like by setting fire to that straw roof.
903675889	Uh sure. 
1268755401	What about that wagon?
1203879636	I could...push it onto the tracks.
939575221	It looks pretty heavy to me.
2126890189	Come on. I can do it... I think.
207599633	Well, if those are our options, I'd feel much more comfortable in disguise.
594603374	Anyway, let's get going. I don't want to spend a second more in this damn hole.
354720800	Careful. You don't want to be run over.
1651932391	Sure, maybe we can use it for cover.
1239211830	Look alive. Another train coming through.
1688956331	Did you find it?
267081196	Not yet. I'm sure I lost it around here somewhere.
533668900	How the hell do you "lose" a gold tooth, you dumb shit. 
1344476213	Train's coming. Get your ass of the tracks.
1593569900	So how did you lose it?
1727713983	Smashed my head on the tracks, duh. Jeesus!
1888250129	What? How? Why the hell did you do that?
1455771679	Train. Train! Come on, move it!
142048326	So, come on, how the hell did you bash your head on the tracks?
1825482064	I was drunk, okay? Now shut up—I need my gold tooth. Goddamnit.
2113775609	Heh heh, figured as much.
1467008996	Hah...phew. I'm soaked. 
1955545827	Tired already? Come on, I'll show you how it's done.
1765165076	Hey shit! You're just shifting dirt around!
381237179	Think you can do better? Be my guest.
628505397	Hah...Jesus...help me out here.
271460853	He he, wheezing like my grandma.
1072556048	Why do we have to dig this stupid-ass hole anyway?
371455958	Don't know, don't care.
1606235648	We're in.
34501587	What a dump. Heh, reminds me of back home in Texas.
63273188	Hadn't figured you were from Texas.
153673205	Born and raised. No place like home, am I right?
182200415	Yeah.
1111178410	Come on girl. I'm a customer.
1893836248	I'm off shift, asshole. Back off.
283633755	You just keep gettin' prettier.
1472601243	And your breath keeps getting nastier.
588172176	Can't you see? I'm thirsty out here.
53960979	Darling, I'd rather sit on a porcupine.
459331803	I just can't get enough of you, sweetie.
930206091	Why don't you go get run over by a train.
1736725651	Well I ain't goin' anywhere, sweetie.
1369324787	Well then, stay on your side of the tracks.
1801040032	Not sure I can keep up my usual act right now.
340926838	Heh, you can do it. I believe in you.
1469241437	Well, that's something I suppose.
1421036439	There's the station.
369191320	No sign of Doc. Maybe he caught a train in time?
93472741	Either way he's gone.
1855504428	Look who's watching from above.
1083424770	Guards in high places. Wish we had Doc.
2107985558	Shame he left us hanging.
1033327917	I'm starting to get used to disappointment.
631301577	All right. Let's head this way.
869649447	All right. Let's head for the cattle.
642820717	All right. Let's head for the wagon.
657715497	I hope Cooper's all right up there.
1999816303	Can't say I care. Once we're out of here, I'm done.
1700712163	Come on, Kate. You know Cooper's not a bad person.
283030725	He lied to us. He shot you, and then he left us behind.
1040028150	Yeah. That was pretty shit. 
624671212	We're almost there.
1368507796	Almost there.
949127210	We do this, and then we get Cooper and Isabelle. 
229958968	I don't get it. How can you still trust Cooper?
81941703	You know, I did some real bad things too. And he still trusts me. 
1983670172	What do you mean?
950969448	Just give him a chance. Do it for me, okay?
941864543	Whatever. But we still have to stop the train first.
467409787	There's the cattle pen.
1124021518	There's the cattle pen.
2090340079	So let's set fire to the stable roof.
990017966	Heh, we're gonna scare those bulls good.
2043144075	Again? What the hell do I care about this fucking animal?!
1828508821	Raton's a prize bull. He needs to be strong for the fight tomorrow.
969014820	How much hay can this thing eat?! Fine, fetch another.
1492622150	Thank you, good sir.
2055259032	Weren't you just here? Don't tell me it's the bull again?
1919537805	Raton needs more hay. He needs to be big and strong, for the fight.
1259704800	Yeah yeah, for the fight. Fetch your hay before I lose my temper.
1651156154	Many thanks, good sir.
981648462	Are you shitting me? Again with the fucking bull?
969053577	So sorry sir, but Raton needs to eat. If Raton doesn't eat, he doesn't win.
1387508682	Can't catch five minutes... God damn it, get your hay already.
1263701317	Raton will be grateful, good sir.
1520041738	Hey. What are you staring at me for, woman?
1856831327	Raton needs water. I have to bring him water.
1108018588	Then bring him water. What's with you people?
1708713104	I will bring him water.
742499765	I know you're staring at me, you damn hag! What is it?
417326690	You can drown the fucking beast for all I care.
310665764	Stop staring at me! You wanna bring him water, do it.
321519532	Raton is thirsty. I bring him water.
585996427	Christ, I just wanna catch a break. Just leave me alone!
1300607775	Looks like they forgot about you, he he he.
705556329	Stupid animal.
1872556597	Aww, no more food and water? Poor thing.
1193242844	He he he he.
1462959553	What are you looking at, you stupid ox?
2114693981	Gets on my nerves.
1531055623	We got fire.
1968787874	Good. Onto the straw roof with it.
1738793077	There's the wagon.
1200699928	There's the wagon.
1641166974	You sure you can push it? I bet it weighs a ton.
20553821	Of course! Just leave it to me.
398414947	You want more, sir?
50964226	You keep pouring until I say otherwise.
317194211	My great-grandfather made this moonshine.
885965165	That's very considerate of him.
259476907	Good, yes?
27843187	Yeah. Goes down like fire. Give me another.
28736089	You like it, yes?
693567082	Shit yeah. Maybe I won't shoot you after all.
2102922976	More drinking, less shooting.
1051775363	Heh, smart man. Keep it coming.
1121339698	(hic) Finally!
527118112	How about another for the senorita?
2093372229	(hic) Huh? Wha?
89932817	And here's another for the senorita.
1050081051	My head...s-spinning... 
581065887	One more for you.
874767312	Ugh...gonna...urp...
1988163586	One more, yes?
761881220	Hrgn...
61274360	Not too shabby, Hector.
1913679246	No...problemo...
1408503555	Hah! It worked.
1946636562	And there we have it. Feels good when a plan works out.
458713694	That's a lot of guards.
1136424161	Oh my. Guess we caught a train full of DeVitt men.
1095934310	That wagon seems to be the only safe option.
819726597	Let's meet up with the others, then hide inside that wagon. 
1559412081	Ugh...sleepy...
545629626	Hrm... Huh?
7069839	Hey, you breathing?
182103101	zzz
2013124401	 Heh...sure.
816953267	All right, let's go meet the others.
1717046167	Where did they come from?
1373663779	Get the damn things off the tracks.
545599609	Uh...they don't look like they wanna move?
114078305	Maybe we scare them off or something.
1637933368	This is gonna take a while.
485862675	What the hell is this?
1597789739	Get that damn wagon off the tracks!
1863929236	Uh, looks pretty heavy.
1887029504	Ideas anyone?
1807402843	This is gonna take forever.
398126939	The train's stopped. Looks like they did it.
1291452226	Hey Hector.
458740498	Hey amigo! How you feeling.
914036743	Better. Let's get out of here.
1819088506	Kate.
1834474394	Cooper.
135792154	Hey, uh...nice job with the train.
1676367730	Thanks. But we're still not out of here.
762197865	Isabelle!
773869525	Hey, it's Belle!
2008787869	zzz
1727731140	Asleep. Where's Cooper?
507372203	What happened to Isabelle?
159547353	What happened to Isabelle?
620612818	She patched me up. Think she just needs rest.
875062033	What's that racket back there?
1217519499	Quiet down back there, Jesus!
740640140	Quiet! To hell with the people in this town.
148000275	Wait a damn minute...
1507422999	They ran off on me?! I don't believe this.
223240633	Somebody go and clean up this mess!
1590059287	After you, Miss Moreau.
202440383	There you go, Belle.
1418097853	Isabelle's on board.
1220205093	All's clear!
1541701335	Finally! We gotta make up time.
489276961	Next stop: civilization.
598497005	Ah...I need to sit down.
1699957185	So where do we go from here?
1619326542	I'd say we pay our friend the Marshal a visit.
909407458	Block the Train Tracks
17797167	Stop a train by blocking the tracks with something.
110556005	Scare the Cattle
90619246	Grab a torch and throw it on the hay to chase the cattle onto the tracks.
1294648201	Push the Wagon
1771071321	Use Hector to push the wagon down the slope and onto the tracks.
1750250218	Board the Train
118152795	Get everyone on board the train.
339265412	Disguise
555424721	There's this prostitute in town. Kate could really use a disguise.
2108537596	Ah, Frank, there you are.
1260959731	Did you already brief the men for the evening?
778998063	I expect everyone to be on your best behavior when the guests arrive.
1659846400	Do me the courtesy and look at me when I speak to you.
1553043809	I've just been thinking.
1782845682	I'm kinda tired of you, Vincent.
1258618146	Please, Frank.
578298804	I really think you're too old for this kind of stuff.
1753186492	Maybe you're right.
446897044	I'm too old to mingle with trash like you.
1019580857	Frank.
1056529862	Don't just stand around, you buffoon.
395160447	Come on, Frank.
326060142	You think you got what it takes, Bill?
374421595	Didn’t think so.
424427652	Enjoy your party, Vincent.
1022877229	Enjoy it like there's no tomorrow.
1893174963	What now, sir?
1352081880	Nothing.
466600239	We proceed as planned.
286916777	I won't accept any further interruptions.
1053507609	VO TRACK
918851178	May I help you, Miss O'Hara?
259808903	I don't think anybody is watching us here.
2042271898	Just trying to get in the mood.
1460644068	Are you.
1345250752	I say you two make a fine couple.
767993458	Maybe it's a bit much.
1366589920	It'll be fine, but we should get rid of those irons.
1911995687	They don't fit your new look, Mr. Cooper.
1353129268	Well...
1581921180	...I'm afraid you got a point there, Marshal.
1689062683	Now that's a sight I could get used to.
184271111	All right, let's go through the plan.
984542604	VO TRACK
383101198	DeVitt's party's underway. Naturally, he's made himself the center of attention.
2084697177	You'll need to get in there, knock the bastard out and, well, extract him from the premises.
658204526	Remember, I want him alive. So don't be too rough on him.
72267178	I also don't want any of the guests to be harmed, you got it?
613008332	Drag him to the wagon, then saddle up and get the hell out of there. 
1437837658	DeVitt has two major events planned for this evening.
63699860	At the front gardens, there's a firework show under preparation.
2111270962	You don't need to light up both stashes. Just pick one and light the fuse.
1863947050	And in the backyard, DeVitt's gonna show off some new invention to the guests.
87798289	You're gonna need a strong guy like Hector to start the generator before you flip the switch on the main thing.
997303326	If you manage all of that, it should be enough to draw the guests away from DeVitt.
1967667379	Your friends should have arrived down at the shore by now. They'll make their own way in.
392671691	And that's about it. Show your invitations at the front gate and enjoy the party.
1209422243	I'm gonna head out in a bit. See you back at the meeting place. And good luck.
1905302755	Should we head in, Miss O'Hara?
135070172	Someone's taking his role quite seriously, Mr. Cooper.
342061846	I'm just following the plan.
909257755	All right, let's do this.
232516660	A dead civilian. Marshal's not gonna like that.
1808431973	We killed a civilian. What's the marshal gonna say?
1093574551	Wait, that's no guard. The marshal's gonna be pissed.
1249882110	That wasn't a guard. Wayne's gonna bust our asses.
1764205916	I'll be counting on you.
261744105	Go on. Enjoy the party.
1371704781	Let's catch the bastard.
1784503016	Long line. 
1597495231	Let's play nice. The marshal wouldn't want us to harm any guests.
1788317662	Doesn't mean we can't cut in.
658016637	May I see your invitation?
1673198202	Your invitation please.
992364733	Thank you ma'am. Enjoy the banquet.
726227056	Thank you, sir. Have a pleasant evening.
2017930339	We were here first.
1171645227	How rude.
1319204336	Who are they?
516745338	Must be new money.
883809050	Well, there goes our ticket in.
927645009	Come on. Wasn't he supposed to let us in?
1204959319	Guess we'll have to find another way.
1249683220	We fit right in.
1447453001	Gotta say, I feel kinda naked without my holster.
237954651	Maybe you should try it more often.
554930580	Kinda jealous you get to keep your little pea shooter.
933550077	Well, it pays to know who to point it at.
1486085774	Mhm.
67172205	This place is...impressive.
1526774279	So, should we go in? Mingle with the fancy folk?
1912676651	Come on Cooper. Let's not forget why we're here. First the distractions, then DeVitt.
873168970	A maze, huh?
1885391290	The marshal said there's fireworks in there. Let's explore.
1555792696	Right behind you, Miss O'Hara.
501325046	Nice quiet garden.
801218685	According to the marshal, there's fireworks near the pond.
901675205	Well, we don't have far to go then.
1089249859	Beautiful place. Shame it belongs to such an awful man.
1594908787	Mhm. Not for much longer though.
1570932987	Let's hope so.
1972120744	Thanks for letting me help out.
537940957	We both know I couldn't do this alone.
605139133	What I mean is...I'm glad we're doing this together.
1505054090	Right...
958692602	Let's get back to it then, okay?
1055111395	Right. Let's do it.
921663647	We better keep our heads down here.
1643575486	Back to hiding in the shadows.
1915308774	DeVitt sure knows how to throw a party.
74463685	So this is the main event. And there's Mr. DeVitt himself.
2016360406	Should we introduce ourselves to the host?
618550959	Let's not get too cocky.
168477056	Pretty quiet back here.
303836523	The marshal mentioned some sort of invention being prepared in the backyard.
417392981	All right then, let's have a look around.
1153453160	This must be where the servants live.
60855948	Think I see the wagon. So that's how we get out of here.
699061992	Right. With Devitt in the bag.
1498793038	All right. We're here.
497704934	Uh, could you let down that ladder?
1907508189	Heh, don't worry big guy, I gotcha.
93544555	Thank you.
1812948111	You know, this would be a lot easier if you could swim.
958036718	Uh...I can...but I have to carry Bianca.
723560253	This looks like easy going.
1866936801	Single patrols, long routes, clear view. McCoy would have a field day out here. 
666346151	Sounds like you miss the old grump.
1742579761	Yeah, like hell.
1151020941	Bill was there when he left. Said he couldn't move a muscle.
2094191941	Nobody messes with Frank.
1104217739	Why'd he leave all of a sudden? I don't get it.
1822335833	Guess he finally got fed up with DeVitt.
1067687447	You hear about that cowboy? The guy who came for Frank.
1750385929	Sure. Probably died of gangrene by now.
623712389	Nah. He's alive. Broke out of DeVitt's gold mine two weeks ago.
750065515	Well, if he's still chasing after ol' Frank, he won't come here.
662181392	Heh, we're in.
1379795607	Remember what Wayne told us. We can't kill any of the guests.
1542228241	Sure. I'll just put them to sleep instead.
1002334850	Well well, look at this place.
673672528	There's the party. I can smell the food from here.
959790353	Keep it together, Hector.
424716704	A hedge maze, huh? Fancy.
826972201	I hate mazes. We really going in there?
1533758169	I think you can handle this one.
1069120319	Hey, what's this place for? 
1508659987	Now that's a pretty stone garden. DeVitt has it all.
1660180216	What do you mean. It's just a big square with a puddle.
2009509478	Huh? What's back here?
199489402	See the wagon? That's how we'll get out of here. 
1837426009	Heh yeah. With a package in the bag.
1129178538	Glad to see you made it.
1439874856	How was the boat trip?
889931331	Mr. Cooper and Miss O'Hara need you.
396219001	I hope this is all to your satisfactions.
1602033482	Don't worry. We'll have time for business later.
1547336292	If you're interested, meet me in my room after the show.
1388804315	How's the missus? Everything all right back home?
1819279765	You must try the food. My chef has outdone himself.
827234220	You like the wine? Came in straight from Italy.
930016210	Enjoy the music. It's all the fashion around here.
1691927499	Believe me, I have spared no expense.
1455707242	Miss O'Hara, what a surprise!
417285690	We have some unwanted guests here!
149881236	Nuh uh. Hands off.
173249229	Oh come on, just a sip.
1566858105	It's wine. Grape juice.
224186850	Hrm, fine.
693842402	From the top. First song's about a boy and his father walking the roads of life.
2087470586	This next one's about the iron horse and the hardships it has faced.
654436549	The next one's about a bar fight that spreads throughout a town.
1275003105	The next waltz we normally play at weddings, but it's good for all occasions.
602857501	Now here's a special ballad. A girl who loses a loved one. Tragic.
1819878868	This next song is about the bridges we build and the bridges we burn.
998399739	To those who enjoy a good drink: This next song's for you.
1561246608	The next favorite's about riding down the Mississippi.
949126592	If you've ever been to New Orleans, this one's gonna remind you of that lovely place.
1740787153	This one's about an old steamboat and her last voyage into the bayou.
2045210435	Here's a more personal treat. It's about old grudges and new friends... and betrayal.
1524490966	This one is based on an old gold miner's song.
509016721	Next song's about the desert, and the towns where trains don't stop no more.
1176200478	Last one. It's about changing times and the challenges we face.
1219421044	All right, I got one more. This one's a classic. Hope you like it.
203571918	Ho hoo. Look at you, amigo.
1071201345	Yeah yeah. Good to see you too.
1511974876	Glad you made it here in one piece.
1223108790	Don't worry about us, Cooper.
1673485033	Good to see you, Hector.
132914728	Heh, me? You're the looker around here.
1583162982	Hey Kate. You ready to kidnap a rich guy?
1094152163	You betcha.
1825854098	Looks like we found the fireworks.
1130256363	There. Those must be the fireworks.
1213693394	We're gonna need some privacy before we light the fuse.
1532728162	Hey, I think we found the fireworks.
1764558911	There. The fireworks Wayne told us about.
1373581082	Let's light them up.
1783398701	Everything ready?
1914135370	Yes. Relax.
270765384	We don't wanna be late.
130153519	We got plenty of time. Calm down.
1404913273	You sure the fuse is dry.
776860320	Yes I am.
1678323984	I'm just saying, we gotta be ready.
1873845656	Christ, gimme a break.
430006511	Gotta be time soon.
640586162	You're driving me crazy here.
440911160	You know what happens if we screw up.
1133468850	We won't. Now calm the fuck down.
1263447634	This bench is too hard. Let's find a better one.
579275607	All right honey.
2112789733	There's a draft here. Let's go somewhere else.
719859688	Of course, honey.
498532988	It's too quiet here. I don't like quiet places.
1206686854	Me neither, honey.
875901924	What's wrong darling? I like this one.
1284376580	I don't know, it's like someone's watching us. Let's go.  
1435434783	Hey, uh...everything ready?
1512467395	Yup. Just gotta light the fuse, and it's all flash and pretty colors.
1216862342	Good... That's good. Continue.
1788097092	You, uh...you're doing good out here.
2120991209	Well thanks, Bill. That's mighty kind of ya.
1567705816	Right. Uh... I...I'll go back on patrol.
449788552	Anything ya need?
2131619723	I like it better out here away from their shine.
888186537	I could still use a drink.
2137496751	Oh ho ho, Gerome! You're such a charmer!
1805277800	The words flow like a fountain directly from my heart's own well.
1135113243	What if someone sees us?
339984990	Let them see us! We have nothing to hide, Dolores. Nothing.
199478141	What will our families think of us?
229802176	Forget them, Dolores. From this moment, our hearts are our own.
1558108678	I wish this moment would never end.
1534441373	What fiend would dare disturb us, now we finally found each other.
1635449484	Light 'em up.
243727080	Let's give them a show.
1287838523	Here we go.
1951732879	Eyes up.
1458496835	Hrm. Looks like the fireworks crew lost the schedule.
433683055	Would you look at that!
311955387	Let's go out and watch!
605339567	I admit, it's quite beautiful.
222351628	Looks like half of the guests agree with you.
1431323880	Means we're halfway there.
2089889703	Heh, and then it's payback time.
1598006555	Looks good, huh?
618442596	Sure does. Half of the guests seem to think so, too.
1691883871	One down, one to go.
120271706	And then, it's payback time.
595140102	Look at that!
2096845180	Astonishing!
793393652	Spectacular.
115158067	Fantastic!
329062007	Ho hoh!
913186926	Marvelous!
52592200	Truly impressive!
817636779	Meh. I've seen better.
1574236295	...! Oh my. 
1933425154	Look at the colors.
308375550	Quite spectacular.
149699412	Beautiful!
2136478388	Ooh!
376738704	Did you see that?
341484076	Breathtaking!
633775725	Good heavens!
1482743495	Quite something to behold, isn't it?
1627518804	And the evening has so much more to offer.
1669693489	Yes, just a slight change in schedule.
1187095878	I thought the guests could use some entertainment.
1107966732	Don't worry. My men are professionals.
895676895	Yes, I have a weakness for the exotic.
1959588534	Did I promise too much? I think not.
1433994186	Care for more wine? Or a little bit of music?
1266921645	It is less crowded now, isn't it?
1535120832	Nothing like a little early evening entertainment, yes?
1998599449	See that? Some kind of glass balloon.
1212910311	That must be the invention Wayne was talking about.
1438719643	He also said we need Hector for the generator.
1459273202	I'm on it, amigo.
907258221	What's with the glass ball?
1856615947	That must be DeVitt's new toy. Wayne said you'd have to crank up the generator.
1128272690	Heh, leave it to me.
541925172	Ready when you are, Hector.
370559760	All right, something's happening.
1998560206	Something's happening. Try the switch.
2134087233	Too slow.
1611897409	Too slow. Again.
1053329122	Dead. We need the generator first.
184350688	Nothing. I think we need the generator first.
549858308	Uh, nothing. I'll try the generator.
1444807405	Nothing happening... That leaves the generator.
2056788017	I've seen it! Brighter than hellfire.
2074717416	Bullshit. Show me then.
1004794332	I ain't got the strength to crank up that generator.
1848169077	We could ask Bill, or any other of the Long Coats.
917455560	Don't bother. Bill's got a woman on his mind.
306594813	But what's this got to do with the glass thingy?
1634336736	You wind up the generator, then you pull the switch.
605949877	If you don't, the generator shorts out.
1723584281	You don't make no sense, Harry.
633693576	Not sure I understand it myself really.
188809333	Hah! That's it!
1594072898	Sounds about right.
1072230452	Wow! We got light.
1712923174	Let there be light.
277373840	My instructions were clear...
1084776472	Oh my! Quite spectacular.
646406926	Let's go see it up close.
1013880880	Looks like the party moved.
998001442	Which means we can start the main event.
720082183	Hah, good work you two!
445795804	Hector, Isabelle. Fancy meeting you here.
401358094	Heh, same to you.
2065916538	Heh, looks like the guests are leaving DeVitt hanging.
1646482791	Means we can move on to the next step.
1700099842	Nice work y'all.
485786867	Look who's here. My my my, you two do look fancy.
119315817	Why thank you.
722084301	What is it?
1283379088	My God! A miracle.
117189780	Who's the inventor?
1098694287	The future indeed.
1988253419	It might have its use.
1077363963	How much does it cost?
1642124723	Vincent has outdone himself this time.
1553006550	Spectacular demonstration.
1540091437	A bit hard on the eyes, though.
1542772251	Devil's work!
119837162	How does it work?
829902920	It's quite...something!
1411352776	I've never seen the like.
1245952230	I'd like one for the house!
182481967	The children would love it.
489587310	Marvelous contraption.
627462957	The sound it makes?
1604354231	Is it safe to touch?
1206327872	Ah! So bright!
904685417	A bit frightening, isn't it?
975907213	So what are we waiting for. Let's grab DeVitt.
10418643	We gotta make sure the coast is clear first.
672497951	Means no guards watching from the upper floors.
1993937476	Let's get to work.
1924064683	Not many folks left down there.
669798481	Almost deserted.
114161847	Not too much happening down there now.
16344821	Ain't much happening down there now.
1584014028	And DeVitt's not happy about that.
1211808247	He probably thinks this can't get any worse.
1156378543	Let's prove him otherwise.
1785098953	Think I see the wagon down there.
1671420536	Hm, I can see the wagon down there.
1823263670	Down there. I see the wagon.
443779208	You can see the wagon down there.
127900034	Pretty nifty how the marshal arranged all this.
1493995054	Wayne's usually the man with the plan.
1526576723	Still, why didn't I get a fancy suit?
609802937	Aww, there there Hector.
1905479749	The thieves' highway.
2056089867	Top of the world.
1735223757	Uh...pretty high.
841474490	So this is how DeVitt spends his money. 
1877114534	Yeah. The building is impressive.
236408482	And very big.
1831234351	Must be compensating for something.
110845566	Nice view. You can see the whole lake from here.
142193377	Wow, you sound almost cultured!
1229304922	I can appreciate things like that.
811565412	There's DeVitt. He's ripe for picking.
79522458	There's DeVitt. We're almost there.
2131662019	Heh, I see DeVitt. Let's do this.
664649765	Got eyes on DeVitt. We're close now.
378815034	Well done, gentlemen. The party is officially a fiasco.
361255572	And now you are going to tell me who is responsible.
891726685	Still nothing? Maybe you'd all want to take responsibility?
1387183924	How often must I tell you, you imbeciles?!
350466371	I did not rise this high in life by ignoring blatant mistakes.
788895774	My father gave me a dime and threw me out on the streets.
534494589	I clawed my way to the top. I earned my place at the table.
1848542513	The railroad, the gold mines, the convict trade...  
234954622	None of you will ever accomplish a fraction of that.
529821948	No. You cretins had only one, simple, incredibly basic job. 
1339704689	How the hell did you screw that up, huh?! Answer me!
193754288	Did I tell you to stop playing?!
1823918205	...
22508266	Now...where was I?
183314648	Ah yes. Don't think I forgot about you lot!
240191672	All gone, huh? Unbelievable. Well, I can wait.
342974500	Ah, the migraines again. I need to clear my head.
335177102	It's a small issue. Easily rectified.
1447888422	Still. Failure must not be tolerated.
2020837825	Idiots. I'll need to find replacements.
132045302	All in good time, Vincent. All in good time.
914391697	Shit. He's dead.
2079300677	Oh my. Dead.
1221040973	Uh...he's dead.
1320852010	Damn it. He's dead.
1152424784	Lights out, Mr. DeVitt.
1968833740	That's for Uncle Ian.
491568939	Nighty night, asshole.
2123798270	Gotcha, little bastard.
1357074830	Better lay still now, Mr. DeVitt.
1539217259	Hey there. He's ready for the road.
1463148158	Gonna make this extra tight.
685985368	Hrm... Got you, you bastard.
2060295198	Hey. You good there?
290167613	Never felt better.
958075556	We did it. We got the bastard.
1655765715	All in a day's work.
1412284541	Yup. No problem.
60990168	I like him more this way.
1883028320	Okay, let's get him to the wagon.
1913966354	We're making good time.
1991932564	Not much longer now.
1749814141	We're getting there.
1421320260	Heh... Easy peasy.
747356456	If only Uncle Ian could see us now.
1422512761	What do you mean?
1949499521	Kidnapping DeVitt from his own mansion. He'd find that hilarious.
1761273905	Well, then let's hope he's watching.
1380498207	And there's the wagon.
291986284	I can see the wagon.
585863495	Ah, there's the wagon.
2037499362	Nice going. The wagon's close.
1816773264	The wagon... Not much farther.
1878566244	Last stretch. We get DeVitt there, we're out.
1860386437	Almost done. Hard to believe really.
1363611135	How do you feel?
2125225756	Better. Thanks Cooper.
2128115776	All right. We got him here.
451885063	DeVitt's at the wagon.
1112561309	Ah, we're at the wagon.
1011158702	All right, DeVitt's at the wagon.
1725643065	There...he's at the wagon.
1509761340	Let's wait for the others before we leave.
1988633774	All right everybody, let's get out of here.
467219153	Join the Party
1319022999	You have the clothes, you have the invitations. Time to join the party.
975466653	Distract the Guests
908275987	You won't be able to take DeVitt while he's mingling with the guests. Create distractions to draw the guests away from him.
26479540	Fireworks
504684216	Start the fireworks at the maze or the pond to draw guests away from DeVitt.
1025877990	Contraption
628327464	Start up the contraption to draw guests away from Devitt. You will need Hector to crank up the generator.
1700878046	Capture DeVitt
1392731929	It's time to take care of DeVitt. Knock him out and tie him up.
279664770	Leave Hacienda
1050130564	You have DeVitt. Now gather everyone at the wagon and leave.
596462338	Devitt
1066922073	Get DeVitt to the wagon.
175237739	Meet Up
1129961709	Gather everybody at the wagon.
1002241300	Don't Kill Civilians
475284133	The marshal doesn't want you to kill any of the guests. The staff is off limits too. You can still knock them out and tie them up.
1366672037	Fireworks (Pond)
1660492158	A guard is preparing fireworks at the pond, next to the bridge.
1430380519	Fireworks (Maze)
1475806185	A guard is preparing fireworks in the maze, next to the large rock.
207945193	Devitt Statue
1531077172	Hector can push over this massive statue. Wouldn't be the first time someone got killed by DeVitt's ego.
701354613	Generator
666223160	Before you can flip the switch of the contraption, Hector must turn on the generator.
1618469470	You can't kill civilians in this mission.
228316702	He's taking his sweet time.
368956181	Heh. Wayne's not the youngest horse in the shed.
758825814	Guess we'll have to wait then.
1553066782	Hphm!
1937180756	Hey hey!
1384042418	I suggest you lay still Mr. DeVitt, or Hector's gonna put you to sleep.
706765557	Don't bother. He's just gonna try to bribe us.
347712331	Hphm! Hphm!
173158409	Let's hear it.
325694438	...I need to relieve myself.
1050952151	Really?
145756330	Yes really, you imbecile! 
1885428638	All right. Take 'em out the back.
1898142263	Hrm, let's go.
1469160685	We really did it. We caught the bastard.
1040973513	Your uncle would be proud.
1370671344	That's sweet of you. 
763470705	You know...back there, in New Orleans...
2069859642	It's fine.
1507501123	You did what you had to...
264764159	Yeah right.
466023997	I was a goddamn idiot.
1229941762	True.
2056124374	And what are you now, John Cooper?
1255340643	Oh come on...
374962282	Shut up! Everyone get over there, or I'll blow him to smithereens!
459428926	You think I was never put in a corner before?
1744939186	Never had to get my hands dirty to climb the ranks.
684306120	I've had my hands so deep in shit you can't even imagine.
1733879247	Sorry. I fucked up...
215003338	I said shut up!
2143841398	I will show you what happens when you stand against me...
1023272476	AGH!
1805056164	Ugh...
1446748664	You?!
622903884	I had a feeling you'd be lost without me.
2005456417	As usual I was right.
963444610	Heh, you know what? I'm gonna give you that one, Sunshine.
1241478166	VO TRACK
1150577824	To be honest, I was expecting to find him in better condition.
590958068	Don't worry. McCoy says he'll live.
136765841	I'll take his word for it.
519762925	Now, I believe these are yours.
1429164747	Colt Navy 51. It's seen better days, if you ask me.
402068794	I'm attached to it.
1912305919	Now, if you excuse me, I have a package to deliver.
1867244858	And you also got something to take care of, am I right?
1016527966	Right.
177826815	Good luck, son.
725650914	Ready when you are, amigo.
837981845	So how do we find Frank?
2146263122	Just follow me.
1559753706	VO TRACK
2071875988	You coming?
1158993043	Come on, amigo. You're starting to act like some big hancho.
1459108587	Not my fault if you're taking ages to get up here.
193011974	Easy, boys. We're all here for the same reason.
834789043	There's the chapel. Place hasn't changed much.
858126338	And you're sure Frank's in there?
1172816432	Oh, dead sure.
1469677172	Remember Cooper, nobody goes in alone. We all meet at the gate.
401110194	Heh, don't worry. I'll follow the plan.
2102348602	Speaking of which, there's Doc and Isabelle.
1662801551	Good. We'll meet them on the way.
1216793812	Right. And one more thing...
1850715202	That woman down there, in the canyon.
2109716145	I bet I could get around this place if I had her outfit.
894524071	Well, then let's make sure we pick it up.
241450609	Anything else? Are we good?
1068443101	Ready when you are, amigo.
1659278257	All right. Then let's send Frank to hell.
1207488628	Heh, still the old dump.
1532902944	Charming little outpost.
445713930	Wonder if they're still keeping whiskey in there.
900995337	How's it feel, being back here?
94059513	Everything seems a lot smaller, that's for sure.
723002160	What?! Bullshit!
396695495	Holy hell, Williams. How can you be that bad?
869726789	It's the gun! Rusty piece of shit.
1074427449	Oh come on!
1860944481	Ha ha! It ain't the gun who's at fault.
2111207716	Who asked for your opinion?
842365619	God damn it!
1449201902	You ain't gonna be ready at this rate.
2070241680	Shut up. I'm gonna be ready.
436719742	Merda merda merda!
58061221	Forget the gun. Get close and personal.
846733911	Hell no, Frank says Hector's with 'em. Jesus Christ!
257146736	Então, qual o plano?
1785019522	Qual o plano, amigo?
320418139	We follow the path and we get to Frank. Or we head down the canyon and get you that outfit.
469766072	It's your show, Cooper.
1419377760	Let's stick to cover.
26377535	Better stick to cover.
1669382652	Things are definitely getting more crowded.
550384682	I know a few of those mugs. Frank's old gang.
206981119	Hope you're not getting sentimental.
1072954615	Look alive, boys! Let's give 'em a warm welcome.
1729459055	Get ready boys. They're gonna show up eventually. 
982746874	He heh, no one's getting through here. Let them come.
1496161796	Ah, I love the smell of gunpowder in the evening.
324861897	You think it's gonna fall.
1391648668	Only a matter of time.
1443254413	You think we should warn the others?
382875840	Nah. Too much trouble.
74747016	Reminds me of that job at Eagle Falls?
2047922084	Shit. Damn bridge still gives me nightmares.
1524477808	Would you look at that. It finally fell.
505378669	Well, watch out below, heh heh.
1475665866	You think Frank's right? They're gonna come here?
1597536146	You ask me, Frank's getting old.
71648941	No matter. If they come, we're gonna be ready.
2032505512	Hell yeah we are.
1686339757	Let's get this going. I don't wanna be late.
525560537	You're in a good mood today.
2065545980	What's that supposed to mean?
1961986198	There's the McCoy I know.
1767359387	Hrm.
648291760	What?
1488931636	I hate the desert. The sand gets fucking everywhere.
1093594089	Who'd have thought. We got something in common.
1397871176	Heard she was Frank's old flame.
534582613	Bullshit. She don't look half as old as him.
770113302	You think I'm gonna get a shot?
1722620505	If so, she's gonna be a busy woman.
2997346	Frank's pretty sure these folks gonna show up.
747700383	They ain't getting through here, that's for sure.
1787464558	Who are those guys anyway? Heard what they did in New Orleans?
608422099	Let's talk about the woman again.
1517725670	Stay on guard. They might come through here.
1294525673	Frank says they're sneaky bastards. Stay sharp.
1905953505	What's that?! ...No. But maybe... No. Shit...
313671013	Nobody gets past us. You got me?! Nobody!
33295656	I'm heading down. See you later at the bridge.
484670334	All right, but you better not leave me hanging.
593251260	Look who's talking.
1480992121	I can pay. See?
766591345	Oh darling. That's not nearly enough.
1569949258	You think I'm not good enough for you?!
1878510816	I'm here for Frank, honey. I don't do underlings.
1649028087	Come on! I'm a desperate man, here.
1100471636	Oh I can see that, darling.
271106513	You're too expensive, lady.
685227859	That's cause I'm the best in the west, darling.
1817106755	What are you waiting for then? Go fetch him.
492973538	No need for that, darling. Let me enjoy the shade while it lasts.
1176321028	Tell me what you want?
1733437873	Why don't you just make me an offer, darling.
461527655	That's one thing off the list.
791803555	Remember, it'll only be useful until we get to Frank.
1257223832	Let's make good use of it then.
1483186961	You think they'll come through here?
1302296881	If they do, we'll be ready.
1864283092	I don't know. I heard that Hector guy has a huge bear trap.
1233534215	Better watch your step then.
452671297	I hear all kinds of rumors about these guys.
519557456	Like what?
251265714	They took down DeVitt's business in Flagstone and New Orleans.
30008912	Fuck DeVitt. They come here, they're dealing with Frank's gang.
916158040	I'm getting nervous here.
1873753470	Would you calm down already?
986122014	I mean, what do we do if they show up.
1304284863	We pump 'em full of lead. What kinda dumb question is that?
1220253082	Don't see that rope ladder anywhere...
864933468	Rope ladder?
1421217508	Forget it. Should be plenty other ways in.
409956380	This place has seen better days.
1855344224	Heh, look what they've done with the place.
1933370241	Someone needs to clean up around here.
1816639178	What a shithole.
917385025	I get the feeling Frank doesn't do maintenance.
541143520	Hmm, don't know... I think I like it this way.
155206147	Used to be more cover here, that's for sure.
1859527103	I wonder what's down there?
1634941548	What do we have there?
31363583	What's back there?
1318594572	What do we have there?
2106517142	There's a secret path if we stick to the cliffs.
1217781826	You sure know your way around.
89522553	I had a good guide.
563955346	Fifteen paces.
1265145018	Ten paces.
1166585511	Cooper?
683811245	Just making sure of something.
1838845517	Shit. How much longer?
1597618645	Until Frank says otherwise.
1542979841	We could be riding out right now.
435113100	We ride when Frank says we ride.
1410192652	Who are these guys anyway? This is bullshit.
272270312	I dunno. You hear some nasty things about that McCoy.
1109781748	Sure. But he ain't gonna take us all on.
1049087038	He ain't coming alone either.
1830697416	I think Frank is losing it.
842300241	How come?
1742782678	What he said about that voodoo witch? Bullshit.
1590616347	You never know. Frank's seen some weird shit in his time.
594718753	Okay, then what's the cannon for again?
829106166	Security.
1114876175	And why are we aiming at our guy?
1805734018	Practice.
1048377717	W-what if it goes off?
826874440	Tough luck.
969395148	You even know how to fire that thing?
1696701282	No sir.
124097593	Never been through here.
1346907690	Oh yeah. I remember this place.
1254737121	Well this all feels rather industrial.
1762988771	Wonder what all this crap is for.
1403348187	Looks like a mine of all things.
1534619609	Back in the day, Frank took this place over because of the gold mine.
1884731109	Gold, you say?
1927887843	Focus McCoy. We got a job to do.
2081326651	You know, they say he's fast. Really fast.
2090072411	Wasn't fast enough for Frank. 
526605160	Sure, but what about us.
293171659	Aww, don't worry. He comes for you, I'll save your ass.
1191994580	How does he know anyway?
987097875	Who? Frank?
1263595450	Yeah. How does he know they'll come.
2041476279	Frank's an old dog. I'd trust his nose if I were you.
594351528	Hey, you think they got that beauty with her?
691488540	The one who killed her groom? Probably.
1908290552	You won't fall for her, right? Cause you got lady parts.
881157558	Get back on patrol, you dumb shit.
960853970	Shit. It's still not secured properly.
1691853546	I told you, it ain't dangerous.
1260617836	Gotta make sure it's stuck.
1031366330	Are you even listening to me.
1844765622	I ain't gonna be crushed by a fucking minecart.
1454114103	There's no slope here, you idiot.
1233256077	They ain't gonna get me with this.
823372472	Would you calm down already?
1825708499	Never been through here.
83005743	Oh yeah. I remember this place.
397645503	Look at all this.
1335626615	Look at all this rusting away.
873851136	I wouldn't mind taking a gander into one of those shafts.
1659941219	No way. I've had enough of mineshafts.
1648199460	Heh, yeah. Besides, the vein went dry years ago.
447364667	Fine. Let's move on then.
2119533153	You sure there's no gold in there?
261121748	Jesus, McCoy. Hasn't Wayne paid you enough?
1492818609	Not for this he hasn't. A man's gotta cover his costs.
426920849	Okay, halfway there.
2145660389	Halfway there, amigo.
230370717	We're making progress.
1081780746	Halfway to the chapel.
1513828514	We still got a ways to go.
2128859310	How's everyone holding up?
710950701	Estou pronto.
4403149	Same here.
1677025007	Don't tell me you had any doubts.
1427121985	Yeah. We doing this or what?
76931277	All right. On to the chapel.
1578996480	Ah, I see the chapel already.
203454982	Think I see the chapel from here.
866253972	There. You can see the chapel from here.
2025261914	All right. We got eyes on the chapel.
758095571	It ain't far now. Just gotta get through these folks.
660922703	Jesus, how many men does Frank have?
932227896	Doesn't matter. We just gotta thin down the pack.
1412931661	Getting close, amigo.
51392618	Not much further.
115558138	We're getting close.
1118476791	Looks like we're almost there.
1262640139	Remember, we all meet at the graveyard gate. Nobody goes in alone.
1514833812	Sure. But you better shoot the right guy this time.
384662888	I'll think about it.
1209646247	You really think they'll come?
788946975	Frank says so. Frank's usually right.
176763436	You know this one time I hope he's wrong.
560781998	You and me both.
1677861338	See anyone down there?
406158556	Nah. Don't think they'll come our way.
1009920076	Yeah? Why not.
773969835	Cause Frank said they're smart.
1182469128	God this place is a shithole.
850235308	Don't let Frank hear that. He really likes it here.
2064127421	Yeah. But Frank's getting old.
1405621038	I dunno. I can see where he's coming from.
786535949	That's it. Let's wait until everyone's here.
1197556868	That's it. Let's wait until everyone's here.
14666978	So far, so good. Let's wait until everyone's here.
1342962711	That's it. Let's wait until everyone's here.
1106784327	That's it. Let's wait until everyone's here.
972536573	So this is it.
246074666	Just stick to the plan.
1015045220	Like you came up with it.
1189483124	We got your back, amigo.
1898961321	All right then...
1300492355	John...
542269657	Hm...
1808647292	Give him hell.
496136658	Frank!
1638498635	You kept me waiting, kid.
147343473	Hope you don't mind my company here.
1230337671	Now ain't that a little unfair?
699744065	Come on, kid. We both know what's going on here.
1363026705	But that's a game two can play.
1981356010	So what's it gonna be?
709923328	Easy fellas.
859964106	One good shot.
1089007962	That's all it takes, right?
1521570876	Just like in the good old days, eh kid.
427592624	All right.
994610395	Let's do this.
2126222479	VO TRACK
1479806138	All right, what are we looking at here?
161493972	I don't like the look of the folks in blue.
40445990	Frank's old lieutenants. They're not gonna fall for our tricks.
165644794	If one of them catches on, Cooper's done for.
1976217240	Then we gotta take 'em out all at once.
1640516891	What's it gonna be, kid?
1293366771	You got balls, kid. I give you that.
605982068	Hope you didn't think I'd make this easy.
1155764965	Looks like your friends are taking their time.
1122444210	Wonder what your old man would say now.
203020302	Just like the good old days, eh kid?
125050405	I'm counting on you, kid. Don't let me down.
865953531	No hard feelings, kid.
1076843851	Stay down this time, kid.
448543546	Close, kid, but no cigar.
1187322924	Still a lot to learn, kid.
1008428375	Heh...not bad...
1068855608	...Not bad, kid...
1600044611	Hmph...
895512173	Bet he would be proud.
1043485365	You got anything else to say?
805246975	Heh...what's there left to say?
1790702708	One of us dies...
1786402724	...the other one lives...
1447460447	...that's how it's gotta be...
1939865023	One good shot, Frank.
1089400164	Heh...that's right.
547085163	Make it count.
1268457782	VO TRACK
1635724028	Reach the Gate
437322338	Clear the area in front of the graveyard gate and gather everyone for the final confrontation.
1648934017	Defeat Frank
1433246038	Kill Frank and his gang in a single attack. If any of them realize something's up, Cooper will die.
2102198443	Agora é a hora.
698416794	Estou aqui.
954946304	Olhos abertos.
1340980068	Sim, Estou pronto.
2129288339	Como está indo?
1876443714	Mantenha a calma.
601459450	E ai?
588699637	Mantenha sua cabeça baixa.
1705340705	As coisas estão quietas.
1151312318	Não precisa correr.
441073854	Se acalme.
283497359	Droga, esse trem é longo.
385802758	Big heist they got planned here.
881770828	Looks like we're past Denver.
932779879	...Still warming up.
62361224	Let's get started.
474679635	Let's catch a few bandits.
993005470	Needed a walk anyway.
379630895	Let's see what's happening here.
1544431828	I'm warming up.
1274084592	Está cidade ficou brutal.
516373232	Tive que me arrastar para isso.
2037770180	No meio do nada.
993530816	Podemos acabar com isso?
1124133034	Vamos terminar esses caras.
747776312	Vamos lá, vamos se mover.
1428504587	Não tenho o dia todo.
291071232	Continue com isso.
630512329	Ei, lembre-me porque estamos fazendo isso?
1177344540	O que estamos esperando?
467933390	Qual é o problema com esses caras?
1099076121	Lugar movimentado, esta cidade.
739796969	Esses idiotas da empresa estão por toda parte.
2047148498	Tenho que entrar naquela casa.
789707676	Quem vai se casar aqui?
635220013	Casarão. Prefeito tem dinheiro.
704853240	Tenho um compromisso para manter.
1666980653	Estou indo, Frank. Apenas espere.
742499356	Temos que sair daqui.
985938258	Acho que o casamento foi cancelado.
1453580619	Você com certeza agitou o ninho.
329331270	Bem, isso é um fracasso.
1858843361	What did I get myself into.
641998699	Big operation they have here.
243436559	Bridge won't fall over by itself.
1936998677	Chilly morning.
1375638535	First the dynamite, then the bridge.
1172384232	Let's blow that thing up.
230030366	Time for dynamite.
936949971	Stick to the plan.
515495816	Pretty cold out here.
1881502695	These guys don't do half-measures.
99620324	All in a day's work.
1593794439	Steady...
747007217	Yeah... on my way.
623161210	Sure, sure...
1754712091	Yup... meet you there.
453889635	Whew... okay then.
891088826	I hate slavers.
761592845	Whew, close one back there.
1883357226	We ain't out of this yet.
1222595714	Gotta gather everyone.
2131439120	Louisiana... Always a ride.
644137467	Bastards put people in cages.
1760990193	Third ambush I run into this month.
2103844227	We ain't saving that boat, that's for sure.
1546414395	There goes our ride to New Orleans.
1323253740	This place is a maze.
1954104332	I hate the swamp. Too many snakes.
2125316927	So, that's the Queen's Nest, huh?
1873306400	I don't mind tearing this place down.
320729088	Payback time.
639574754	Frank's waiting.
17341483	Let's do it.
1457233154	Ain't far now.
939553804	Pier 9.
1160144569	É isso.
1849250951	Eu vou seguir.
1084314963	Continue.
38890875	Estou com você.
646380282	Ainda aqui.
814187223	Hrgn... Merda.
2097128479	Nós terminamos aqui.
945881814	Vamos sair desse buraco do inferno.
1308614410	Got a train to catch.
1395768645	Wound's healed enough.
94463975	Não tenho certeza se conheço essa dança.
927997024	Mansion in the desert. Figures.
1207572231	How big is this place.
1012801585	Fancy party.
130628810	Least they have music here.
2145520679	M'lady?
1679434983	After you, miss.
1245111996	Let's finish it.
660598120	Takes you back.
79087461	Lembre-se do plano.
819050101	Está no papo.
2082524293	This bounty's long overdue.
1201075925	Para onde?
1007641158	Está ficando pesado aqui.
1398205759	Para onde?
1084713273	Ufa ... ficando pesado.
366416837	Ficando tonto aqui.
961612964	Para onde?
1716606398	Ainda aqui.
46796772	Não é um problema.
348080409	Vamos indo.
1463433715	Hmmm...
1947234583	Devemos?
359168339	Coisa certa.
1970577313	No meu caminho.
210468291	Bem, agora vamos ver...
757603325	Tudo certo.
1397053866	Vamos.
1628140975	Aqui vai.
236156250	ok, tudo bem.
534957763	É agora ou nunca.
820981711	Se apresse.
453091592	Ok, vamos lá.
865856085	Legal e fácil.
1001736202	Estou a caminho.
1675502821	Nada disso.
1646528506	Ah, com certeza.
302820134	Não vai demorar.
1336117382	Te encontro lá.
1028665284	Firme ...
809797818	Sim ... No meu caminho.
100993454	Claro, claro...
950427914	Sim ... Encontro você lá.
1910269486	Ufa ... Ok então.
1505125651	Claro.
1347635512	On it.
1804177769	Feito.
416747010	Aqui vai.
1574564980	Uh huh.
621720614	Ok então.
2111796213	Ok.
1898671880	Eu estarei lá.
261146506	Sim, claro.
664999495	No meu caminho.
323985734	Going for it.
1362306772	Sem problemas.
612305708	Aqui vai.
1256591016	Ok.
830503360	No meu caminho.
841264473	Vamos lá.
26643327	...Sem problemas.
690976930	Claro ... Aqui vai.
1500806084	Sim... Ok.
415349483	Nothing...to it.
1218396589	Ufa ... No meu caminho.
1684779458	...Indo.
878301274	...Over there?
922675365	...No meu caminho.
1646207786	...Vamos lá.
1327747076	...Sim.
1193489465	...Tudo certo.
283904925	Not sure I can take the big guy.
578978790	Sure could use an edge here.
1443281338	I don't like the odds here.
1784029869	Não tenho certeza se posso levá-lo.

1617564281	No need to get bloody.
470405903	I'll get close and personal.
1667889064	Someone's about to lose a few teeth.
1297460134	Bring it on.
8101826	I can take 'em.
1638381450	Right... Bring it on.

1387574570	Watch and learn.
2064314191	Who needs a good killing?
1563062188	Eyes on target.
323137475	Fifteen paces.
163359774	...!

149673680	Shit, where's the knife?!

1598203157	Got it.
713192556	I got enough.
1095701913	Can't carry any more.

1542551767	I'm full.
1728615546	I'm good.
141777261	I'm full.
1961288980	Two's better than one.
209314907	The old and the new.
1734663517	Old and new.
1601511426	I got a bullet for you.
1170826886	Things will get noisy.
383585592	Let's raise some hell.
450925631	Ready for action.
1694294799	Let's raise hell.
1638641825	Let's put 'em down.
1537478334	Could have gone worse.
404133895	The quick and the dead.
1766256345	One-way ticket to hell.
1798818976	That's all it takes.
152069517	Go to hell.
481181933	Like fish in a barrel.
2021715783	Adios, amigos.
1508336640	Damn, I'm good.
2007900503	Someone call the undertaker.
1167027459	Nothing to it.
544386625	None left standing.
1089710076	Call the undertaker.
1125857872	I'm running thin.
1028935016	I'm almost out.
1096727267	Last one.
485884660	Running thin.
1673210728	Almost out.
1832393025	I'm out!
1336983391	That was my last.
269754127	I'm out!
1671670101	That's it.

1304299945	Tudo bem, obrigado.
102752461	Funciona melhor do que eu pensava.
1616576476	Onde você conseguiu isso?
664640296	Obrigado.
937545552	Obrigado.
684673124 	O fusível está aceso!
1391455837 	Aceso.
696313527 	Preciso me livrar dele rápido.
1747968087 	O fusível está aceso!
534057737 	Acendendo.
1841187674 	Preciso me livrar dele rápido.
1857871395 	Até mais!
1054850633 	Atenção!
655306181 	Chegando!
735394820 	Até mais!
1356631450	Atenção!
1601183704 	Chegando!
277891919 	O que temos aqui?
1669593380 	Não se importe se eu fizer.
670267666 	Achado não é roubado.
769039758 	Pode ser útil.
1716686979 	Muito pesado.
1037509372 	Peguei o dinheiro.
1852303705 	Certo ... Meu.
1301664456 	Sim. Pode vir a calhar.
1885282172 	Pode ser útil.
536580680 	Isso é meu.
441838535 	Não se importe se eu fizer.
404465203 	Pode ser útil.
1494139264 	Heh ... Assim como pescar.
1274886341 	Olha o que eu tenho.
1971710575 	Vê isso?
1653780251 	Me lembra o Doc.
1370676411 	Sim. Gosta de pescar.
992292223 	A isca está fora.
1683794939 	Temos fogo.
1324117856 	Precisa de uma luz?
908144739 	Peguei!
1766496773 	Aqui!
1352448581 	Luzes apagadas.
1671337557 	Tenho que perder a tocha aqui.
788213518 	Merda. Deixou-a cair.
592925315 	Porra. Deixou-a cair.
173829260 	Certo, onde estávamos?
2089402234 	Então, como eu estava dizendo ...
1268406319 	Voltando ao ponto....
1596160698 	Hrm, onde estávamos?
1554290899 	O que eu estava dizendo ...
941672430 	Como eu estava dizendo ...
1014431014	Voltando ao ponto...
1151537806	Então, onde estávamos?
1705518745	Como você estava dizendo ...
136592286	Bem, isso está ficando estranho.
418997296	Tem certeza de que quer continuar fazendo isso?
1738455828	Apenas falando, eu tenho coisas melhores para fazer.
245262910	Você já ouviu a história sobre o garoto que perdeu um dedo?
1425203375	Meio que me lembra o que você está fazendo agora.
146625226	Aquele garoto, ele deveria ter se importado com o seu próprio negócio.
1964856913	Em vez disso, ele saiu por aí irritando todos.
1531033611	BAM, assim mesmo ... O dedo se foi.
432826438	Alimento para o pensamento, eu diria.
1344111692	Ei agora. Segure seus cavalos.
745634994	Acho que a dor de cabeça está piorando.
942041567	O que? Quem fez isso?
1226787952	Ok, mantenha-se junto, Cooper.
559462246	Isso não é brincadeira.
1099326977	É melhor se concentrar.
2057283385	I ain't got time for this.
336239423	Eu vou te ignorar.
300773328	Sério? Agora?
1718684240	Vamos lá, isso não é engraçado.
425280255	Podemos fazer isso mais tarde?
1842192593	Burro.
480409856	Eu estou aqui, amigo.
1097837558	Sim, estou pronto!
250669976	Huh?
1948394836	Qual o plano?
1812682509	Vamos nos mexer, amigo.
1649365626	Apenas começando.
827492020	Hector aqui.
1640008382	Vamos dar socos. 
1042687607	Heh heh.
672809010	Hora de ir.
126408856	Relaxa, amigo.
640186093	Não há perigo aqui.
947911949	Onde está a ação?
2082370856	Vamos voltar à ação.
1528949067	Nada para ver aqui.
440642314	O que? Estou calmo.
103917801	Estou apenas começando.
110527718	Esta cidade está ficando uma merda.
649910531	Eu odeio esses caras.
363673124	Quem é o próximo?
24755886	Bom te ver, amigo.
1663725028	Assim como nos velhos tempos, eh amigo?
1473976259	Sim, exatamento o que eu preciso.
494176017	Você está pronto, amigo?
1571304132	Vamos lá, vai ser divertido.
753589059	Você está se divertindo ainda, Cooper?
1475684903	Eles não vão nos ver chegando.
261285234	Ainda não terminamos, amigo.
235193763	Ninguém mexe com Hector.
1913867920	Sim,  vamos caçar.
2028406679	Deixe os grandões comigo.
1085046995	These company jerks are getting on my nerves.
1578894012	Sim, eles não fazem ideia.
1433057037	Bianca está com fome.
580042502	Bwah. Wet beard.
333168304	Bom tempo para uma caçada.
1651356698	Ninguém brinca com meus amigos.
1673905838	Vou ganhar esta aposta.
809902952	Uh, Quantos?
1573782110	Merda, perdi as contas.
101827146	Hah, Bem a tempo.
840900471	Vamos abrir um caminho.
614258468	Merda, esse lugar é enorme.
327565094	Sim... Pronto.
1375981047	Ouh... Hector está pronto.
584563007	Não tão alto.
121229745	Ok... Estou perdido.
217950412	O que? Sim.
423220322	Mantenha-se junto, hombre.
1410043925	Bianca precisa de mim.
2610475		Bastardos dispararam em nosso barco.
1990159601	Eu vou fazer um novo buraco na sua bunda.
1105635547	Bianca quer vingança.
1584913950	Ninguém coloca Hector em uma cela.
309149042	Alguma idéia de onde estamos?
284337048	Bianca não gosta de nadar.
40588927	Heh heh, é hora da vingança.
38007557	Eu vou estragar este lugar.
469394834	Pfuah... Mosca do pântano.
2020555894	Algum réptil por aqui?
631054508	Lembra-me de algum lugar.
1848835559	Esta cidade costumava ser alguma coisa.
1333163562	Claro que eles estão aqui também.
1822990084	Já cansei desses caras.
1228538066	Vamos pegar uma carona.
1872569763	Lugar chique.
1486643159	Vamos pegar o rico.
1568345425	Bianca também é uma bela dama.
1199169416	É bom estar de volta.
1240295110	Heh, tempos diferentes, mesma merda.
1213018281	Frank está esperando.
2055647080	Está no papo.
2030405779	Sem suor.
35439906	Tenho um pacote aqui.
109023352	Onde você quer isso?
570391497	Yeah... Sem suor.
112595052	...! ...! Sim?
239351998	...! Ainda o tenho.
2090078223	Hrm... Eu odeio gaiolas.
1754285984	Não posso fazer muito.
1013565478	Pense, Hector, pense.
1178653186	Porra, eu tenho que sair.
942971735	Vamos lá!
1631900250	Oh, Eu vejo.
408136858	Sim, entendo.
94261056	Muito bem.
871727664	Mantenha seus olhos abertos.
1246721726	Claro, amigo.
1112289709	No meu caminho.
1007467624	Pode fazer.
127388188	Vamos iluminar isso!
188191931	Eu gosto disso!
537737020	Fazendo um movimento.
687059772	Vamos fazer isso.
1416768657	Come on, amigo.
2115627036	This way, amigo.
610283050	You got it, amigo.
1226941011	Keep a lid on it.
1682264968	No rush, amigo.
308241113	Understood.
2120668698	I'll be there in time.
1192837881	Sure, no problem.
987705732	All right, keep it easy.
1471642586	Coming through.
13528526	Sure... Sure thing.
1037870268	Uh, on my way.
423951352	Heh, a little dizzy.
2056776782	No problem ...Ugh.
1657462738	Just gotta stay upright.
1414760920	I can deal with it.
1638530929	Hrm, my head hurts.
804821888	Here comes the postman.
1699178788	Coming through.
1231660015	Over there? No problem.
269441290	Heh, I can handle it.
1694816690	I can do this all day.
695290729	...! Okay!
253846311	...! Coming through.
225638183	Out of my way.
1406923000	...! No problem for Hector.
667793286	...! This is heavy.
80115494	Not like this.
304695326	Think again.
349785224	This is bullshit.
1057311674	Can't do that, amigo.
1594406766	Uhhh... What?
2045087313	Yeah... Wait, no!
1531239806	I don't get it, amigo.
2069991385	I can't get there.
235073940	There must be another way.
843672944	No way, amigo.
784841452	You see a way, amigo?
1467598082	Uh, how do I get there?
1299856943	Ugh, not like this.
2031243946	I don't like the looks of that.
760844559	Someone's in there.
841421886	That's a bad idea.
321794096	Uh... Someone's in there.
388052284	Full house, amigo.
185604206	Hrm... Bad idea, amigo.
365046019	Hrm, locked.
1912997997	Nope. It's locked.
1922107468	Won't budge.
1516699721	Hrm... Locked.
1979640618	It's locked.
1276670348	Won't budge.
399189404	Not ready, amigo.
782024477	Don't rush me.
1301244569	This needs more time.
1318239619	Shit, I'm out.
442835356	Gun's empty.
2016384361	What next?
413100628	All right, what now?
1711975334	That's it.
3450358	Uh, now what?
878608500	That's it, I think.
369453272	Fácil.
1519662815	Está feito.
198083130	Tudo feito.
230799163	No problem.
452328337	Okay, what now?
2057854222	Heh, that was easy.
310162947	Feito? Feito.
667426076	Okay...
1935779871	Okay, they're down.
1852058158	I live for this.
1387419723	There goes another.
1332116681	Hmm, not your lucky day.
770656415	Oh, I needed that!
811686421	Heh, whoops.
1206303774	Uh... Sorry?
557412956	Bad luck, friend.
650886594	Who's next?
650787402	You stay down.
1455720754	Bedtime!
2089910937	Oh, I needed that!
1618737351	Can't stand up, eh?
654206766	Out of my way!
640577126	Go to sleep.
1542097180	Heh, bedtime.
1673228552	Hrm... Still got it.
1727695638	Just stay down, okay.
1103862048	...!
1782786920	...! Hey! Who was that?!
1258989165	...! That all you got?!
1588416986	...
1449735250	Looks bad, amigo...
738876371	...!
2002690239	...!
1324344459	...!
641362319	...!
1649684849	...
661985394	...
1473398606	Oh ho ho, bring it on, punk.
1467638822	All right... Wanna try that again?
1272052373	Ugn... Real funny, amigo.
748975499	Ugn... What gives?
802273558	...! Huh? Oh, right!
1487773027	Heh heh, that tickles.
1319925661	What's that for?
1508323024	Uhh, okay.
1250847421	Heh, feels funny.
1793463481	Heh, that tickles.
1530986113	Huh? What?
1823138492	Who's doing that?
1590218207	Almost got us.
132679273	Idiot. Dumbass.
101563422	Gotta take care of him.
1900726852	I hate swamps...
387995025	She's hurting too. 
1162014817	Damn idiot...
173980752	Gotta find him...
1252697643	We're partners...
1904031594	That's it for DeVitt.
1082986022	Oh, she misses him.
374551834	Heh. Doc, you idiot.
287515230	Been too long.
1057670608	He's gonna do it.
629233623	I need a vacation.
1273982516	Bianca?
239428708	I miss you, my love.
949991015	Bianca, return to me.
782101714	...!
1998380965	Come to Hector.
1347339730	This is nothing.
1256111026	...! Ugh.
235460780	Ugh, come here.
362625999	Hrm, no problem...
24503883	And another one.
1982213864	I got plenty of room.
152480733	Two's better than one.
874465571	Yeah... I can take two.
971184415	Yeah... I got it.
1172827436	Hrm... Steady...
578022143	...!
173665086	This is nada.
166695025	Ah, good spot.
182301127	...! Whew.
29300333	...! My head.
1723331483	Good. Give me a second.
1435389838	Don't move, amigo.
1598955218	I'll make you good and cozy.
1550452129	Heh, sleep tight.
625375198	Don't move, friend.
2092017950	Yeah... That'll hold...
788238649	Hrm, keep still...
933667148	...!
780681512	...!
289324150	...!
281415118	...!
470782866	...!
26237672	...!
1933311844	...
400469358	...
1337021678	...
1303449574	...
743995481	...
2097049521	...
1159855655	Quem precisa de um corte de cabelo?
466784557	Hora do machado.
2134918377	Estou com vontade de cortar.
558071487	...!
1230163587	...!
782585676	...!
642190508	...!
467719832	...!
715726070	...!
2145536981	Oh, estou ansioso por uma briga.
1072026535	Então, quem quer ser o primeiro?
399853762	Deixe-os para mim.
1306910682	Já escovou os dentes com uma marreta?
1124824514	Heh, venha para Hector.
400530881	Quem quer tentar?
1684965429	Aí vem o martelo.
969538124	Ainda posso levá-los ...
1382310737	Hum ... Deixe-os para mim.
1901170403	Bah, venha para Hector.
1969492152	...!
1747988784	...!
1381216359	...!
974800483	Vamos atrair alguém.
891984629	Hora de fazer barulho.
721056351	Vou usar minha voz cantando.
251168187	Tape seus ouvidos.
110265755	Hmmm, lábios secos.
1803648594	...Hombre!
379582184	...Por aqui!
256125331	...Yoohoo.
920161108	...! Ah, merda.
1459691392	...! Hrm, hombre!
124316011	...! ...Minha cabeça.
530325714	Quanto mais melhor.
1508511952	Lá vem eles.
834403941	Está ficando um pouco cheio aqui.
1895958332	Hã? Mais de um.
977078008	Claro... Quanto mais melhor.
1702610447	Hora de usar Bianca.
837498010	Parece um trabalho para Bianca.
265050657	Bianca está pronta.
33696007	...Quase pronta...
2052049174	...Só um segundo...
1748235772	... 
612422343	Lá.
437100548	Tudo pronto.
1596136557	Ela está pronta.
1234721860	Boa gorota.
156554737	Confie sempre na Bianca.
130483807	Ela ainda conseguiu.
989985357	Merda, onde está Bianca?
55254118	Bianca está me esperando.
843497225	Eu preciso pegar a Bianca!
994616390	Lá está ela!
2031935518	Ela parece pronta para mais.
1408150042	Bianca voltou para mim.
1189195007	Hora do ancinho.
1442502761	Ancinho pronto.
90334172	Hah, certo. Essa coisa.
294087789	Hora de ... essa coisa.
460272333	Você não é a Bianca.
621188342	Hmmm... Talvez...
1312734082	Como isso... Yeah.
813342031	Hmm... Bom lugar.
254897708	Isso poderia funcionar ...
957960066	Hmm, como isso?
2037676659	Isso poderia funcionar ...
1507768051	Bem aqui... Hmm.
1701562827	Pronto.
519616382	Tudo pronto.
1207039928	Bata neles.
1023349715	Pronto, eu acho.
348270276	Bata neles.
614102221	Uh, Tudo pronto.
1020944915	Hah! Bang!
1552470216	Heh, boa noite!
982298988	Oh, isso deve doer.
181417726	Heh, nada mal.
1333394758	Hmm, isso deve doer.
1884611526	Faz sua cabeça doer.
2122541859	Ei, onde está o ancinho?
2119985986	Ei, onde você foi?
610307250	Não tem o ancinho.
1009892254	Uh... Where's the rake.
1446488602	Hrm, where'd you go?
210440527	Uh... Lost the rake.
1076543859	Heh, found it.
1254045471	Better keep hold of you.
1214689864	You're mine.
866566272	Hrm, found you.
826916199	Still need you.
1134295938	Hrm, mine.
394425750	This is mine.
375164930	I'll take this.
329741383	Oh that’s nice!
1903918795	I'm full.
1001504622	I got enough.
1420548068	I'm fine.
1665737228	Let's get loud!
200778838	Ready when you are.
850609924	Say hello to this beauty!
1246428347	Hah! Got one!
1758776124	One down!
503697570	Next!
1053830907	Hah! You see that?!
1203058366	Yes! Hahaaaa!
930502651	On a roll!
2119893986	My last shot.
201316300	I'm almost out.
172763044	Oh no, I'm out!
1931814842	Heh, who needs guns?
1401465377	Now I'm thirsty.
364131989	Just a sip.
1132678674	One for the road.
919366449	One for me...
1747943942	Oh, I need one.
63588442	Can't get any more hungover.
916216833	A little pick-me-up.
2099940469	One against the headache.
2105176931	Thanks Doc.
2012563396	Appreciate it, Doc.
629545898	Nice job, Doc.
2015568614	That hit the spot.
1897357532	Keeps you warm.
2070862391	...Hic!
397025085	...I needed that.
221561013	...Ah, good.
133927167	...Heh heh.
1371397740	Little more can't hurt.
561535069	...Hic... Ugh.
638763262	...Ooh.
1956393684	...Whew, dizzy.
1595148081	...Hmn!
1915240785	... ...!
997375335	What's that... Tastes funny.
558598886	Hmm... I feel great.
869625814	Huh... Yeah, not bad.
342970236	So, uh, what now?
1775667351	Heh, look at that fuse go.
2059003475	Light the fuse, and then...
363477709	Catch!
217093870	Hah hah!
521512478	Hey assholes!
69951670	Oh, nice.
1055002501	Mine.
1091963526	I have it.
1866129302	Good find.
35197261	Hey. Money.
494724164	That's a lot of money.
1788848025	Sure. It's mine.
1816583177	See ya.
1923523671	Bye bye.
135242026	Let's try Doc's way.
84246857	Got an idea...
1323212137	Uh, all right...
850532773	Reminds me of Doc...
1344130215	We got fire.
218178323	Nice flame.
795116120	Hah!
594023147	Catch!
501135140	Lights out.
578752190	Can't burn our cover.
1031947388	Hrmm... Dropped it.
1529253350	Fuck. Dropped it.
72645431	Right, where was I...
1920112592	Heh, like I was saying...
446136274	What were we talking about?
990991379	Hmm, where was I...
1545330114	Uh, lost my thought... Ah!
1911150900	Hehe, that tickles.
2124480034	Heh, all right enough.
548118344	Ah, Bianca. How are you doing, my love?
1188219175	Me? Nah, don't worry about me.
311820558	Yes, I missed you too last time we parted.
1713768802	But you know, I always come back to you.
986645499	What's that look? What? You think I have another woman?
1141051141	Never! There is only one for me, and her name is Bianca.
369227646	Yes. You know I'm always there when you need me.
1891325985	Hmm, speaking of which, I think you need oil.
1685218522	Ugh... What's that?
981797687	Oh yeah, that feels good.
2050070219	Hmm... More to the left.
1582358394	Ah... That's the stuff, he he.
952323616	Someone call for a doctor?
1012396517	We got places to be.
940404262	I got the tools for the job.
2016253612	Not sure I trust this.
236690581	Shall we continue?
624414689	I wouldn't worry just yet.
357539524	I'm listening.
1364033839	Let's keep it civil.
1220998962	We won't be noticed.
1805240785	No need for violence here.
1112056591	Gotta love bandits.
1916818303	Ambush right on schedule.
1157287233	I usually work alone.
1969037129	Leave their boss to me.
1433941817	Not sure where this is going.
1197594443	You better have a plan here.
2021248107	Another day, another hunt.
1480722301	This is more like an invasion.
996185450	It's my kind of battle.
82340255	Never minded the dark.
475261043	The storm has arrived.
1453211189	You got me for the day.
773959017	Everybody remember the plan?
773014088	Should have prepared some dynamite.
575416765	Property of the DeVitt Company.
1579480194	Have to adjust for wind up here.
337676197	Goddamn headache...
875032120	Gotta mix me a remedy later.
587404274	Not sure how we got here.
1113855705	All kinds of vermin out here.
2046812905	Looks like an organized ambush.
1386667788	Who the hell is she?
1065345587	Let's get this over with.
114733381	Are we playing detective now?
1132401272	Lots of DeVitt men around here.
311342610	Don't try anything funny.
1637870540	Not a bad place to defend.
967051176	The Queen's Nest. I'll be damned.
825337169	Quite the base of operations.
1986761098	This business has gone on for a while.
1489543067	So that's what the company's doing.
567002511	We're leaving now.
163795993	We only got one chance.
85488484	Keep your head in the game.
10084464	I won't go down so easily.
456084721	Enough. We're leaving.
814916136	Shame that bounty's worth nothing.
1800335542	Not all day you take down a legend.
1311002414	Gotta grow my reputation.
1628068474	We make quite the outfit.
2023472952	I'll follow the plan.
1149202878	Hmm, where to?
1107333237	Let's find a good spot.
529271214	Gotta hide this one.
106322557	My arm's getting tired.
1713765855	Let's keep moving.
654617766	I smell trouble.
141907643	On my way.
1249216033	Hrm, okay then.
2125029863	Understood.
707508975	It'll cost you.
479411224	Straight through hell.
1742092790	We'll see.
223802413	Well, all right.
2082182042	Just what I had in mind.
1122590453	No objections here.
291711218	I got a feeling about this.
730047840	My thoughts exactly.
513714958	Nice and calm.
810590143	Oh, sure.
490000932	Got no problem with that.
986010538	Let's go for a stroll.
945207376	I've been through worse.
1323104561	All right, I'll follow.
651706682	This is only temporary.
1103702807	Let's keep our distance.
121739491	Don't get in the way.
2058370182	I can handle that, thank you.
2055514305	Let me take care of that.
709753764	Let's stay clear of the lights.
746914284	You get what you pay for.
844567954	One by one.
1657074579	That whiskey has my name on it.
915859311	Reminds me of the war.
258071440	You're the customer.
1520486734	As you say.
1778803520	Going with the plan.
821360987	An eye for an eye.
867901267	I'm for a change of scenery.
420809811	This is no man's land.
796236413	Let's make them regret their decision.
1586465826	You can't trust anyone here.
1772466000	Better watch your back here.
2146434607	After this, we're even.
1543920592	Still got my eyes on you.
507109845	Let's cut to the chase.
10096625	This Wayne better deliver.
1132022842	Can't believe she's dragged me into this.
627638010	Guess I'll never work for DeVitt again.
189930149	I don't much approve of slavery.
495580398	Better not fall behind.
898476923	Follow the plan.
1875292781	No mistakes now.
1742175302	Now or not at all.
474668885	Don't screw this up.
312657351	Let's close this up.
2050034621	Sure. I'm in a good mood.
635452075	Here we go again.
767019106	Let's give Cooper his shot.
1868312053	Better stick to the plan.
2003507573	Understood.
318065834	Heading there.
2091381647	Let's drop this one off.
122322793	Out of sight, out of mind.
1063663712	I can't say I like this.
1322436086	Not the most thought out plan.
244920588	This will end poorly.
1350598312	Don’t like it.
327982502	Beg your pardon?
53457678	I strongly object.
1625832902	I refuse.
1115160473	That's a bad idea.
1911831811	Não, por aqui não.
1997734296	The path is blocked.
1282408597	There's trouble inside.
920220359	That would be stupid.
1885169536	Too much company in there.
1368880829	I need my tools for this.
1194508722	Locked. I need my tools.
1621442666	Simple, if I had my tools... 
507965449	This needs a bit longer.
611789502	This isn't ready yet.
1739218102	All in good time.
743199918	Seems like I've run out.
1466592899	I need to restock.
891806110	From nothing, comes nothing.
408832323	All settled.
92278461	Just as planned.
1751314002	Not a problem.
1505360830	It's done.
523620941	Worked out nicely.
805450784	Ready on my end.
1047783190	See you in hell.
136529701	Don't take it personal.
1688540636	They're gone.
1306489412	Meat for the vultures.
923714967	You'll be out for a while.
624315767	Don't worry, you'll live.
815363028	Like the doctor ordered.
117057321	Works like a charm.
1898338655	Might have to tweak the formula.
450403292	They say sleep is the best medicine.
1350167292	...!
1456445083	...! More work for later!
952822456	...! This doesn't look good!
676905047	...
549406239	Bad day for dying...
207838739	...!
106545912	...Sonofabitch.
1182606899	...!
819539142	...!
406145121	...
120408397	...
15031501	...Hrm, amateurs.
1453264637	...I'll remember that.
772328580	...That was unprofessional.
2009660243	Is that a joke?
1092982320	Hey now!
1875591724	I'm losing my patience.
598753243	Can't get distracted.
1437028776	Am I hearing something?
461267854	This better not be her.
806810347	No. Ridiculous.
2003459976	Something's strange here.
1982425537	What's her agenda?
983001212	Can't fool me.
141185570	Things really went downhill.
738896807	I don't like where this is going.
823429653	Maybe it's time to leave.
1238361446	Why am I doing this?
1508683628	It's for the money. Always.
1594207477	Right. Keep it professional.
1896414020	Never depend on others.
328338569	Always work alone.
1858737381	Won't make that mistake again.
963134407	Good to be back.
2022306601	Did she miss me?
1415843763	Never leave things unfinished.
1609768915	...
62629112	Up we go.
233187299	Let's move you out of the way.
1604296276	...
895286241	Here's a good spot.
185995499	Looks about right.
1384002767	You better remain still.
665558363	This will just take a moment.
683175743	Not a peep.
336388820	...!
1334728580	...!
60835322	...!
1324968877	...
1744069298	...
1056104706	...
321329449	Who needs a shot?
1315433550	It works very fast.
795221390	You won't feel a thing.
948065023	...
327437081	...
1860530707	...
425573700	This might take a while.
1138668010	Killing would be faster.
1468453713	All right, it won't end in tears.
517304576	Your conscience will remain clean.
997332774	...
1531700548	...
528822207	...
1181178230	The gas is perfectly safe.
420955164	Handle with care.
653451977	I don't have many of these.
460494900	It's all or nothing.
792650785	hold your breaths.
1712864396	Careful...
2011469625	I got a few tricks in here.
1000381761	Primed and ready.
1259373220	It saved me dozens of times.
1270503732	Let's throw out the lure.
1646349267	It's just like fishing.
1647521821	Who wants to have a look?
778535529	Like a moth to the flame.
1384617644	Here they come.
1978687089	Hook, line and sinker.
1709662791	Heh heh heh.
702441525	That'll teach 'em a lesson.
2081980491	Should have kept your hands to yourself.
1640579543	Works like a charm.
533085221	I gotta fetch my bag first.
1689184405	I left it back there.
323340786	I better get it back fast.
1686165360	Whole again.
1875895356	Everything in order.
1498963882	Nothing damaged.
1071922293	Not even a challenge.
602240561	Let's take care of it...
724516068	This will only take a moment.
1405857102	This will do nicely.
24527301	There we go.
1604046453	I'll take that, thank you.
1126857593	I have what I need.
146560611	I'm afraid I'm at the limit.
161153333	Leave some for later.
381127465	My specialty.
490100847	Oh, I won't miss.
107939255	Steady hands.
1112657547	One less to worry about.
842366710	Never saw it coming.
1631360743	Bullseye.
871683120	One left. Better make it count.
2079511031	I'm down to one.
1978961438	I'm fresh out of bullets.
1201010609	That was the last shot.
629094946	Anyone need a doctor?
1046348731	Who's bleeding?
744354088	Gashes? Fractures? Bullet wounds?
603792009	Let me take care of this.
1890086166	Just needs disinfecting.
251152333	There, all patched up.
727066523	Nothing simpler than that.
782222009	First thing I learned in the war.
1183154629	Give me a moment.
2144476267	Holy hell!
1810706907	Too strong...
2047068224	Sonofabitch...
1050098493	A natural narcotic, huh?
1303092552	You seem too fond of these.
1668977822	I'll take one, thank you.
389425039	The fuse is lit.
166892975	Lighting the fuse.
1772065126	Let's do this quickly.
1768525774	It's gonna get loud.
862239024	Better take cover.
2094870572	Brace yourselves.
427448288	You can never have enough.
171414401	Let me keep hold of that.
400939964	Straight to the bank.
675306451	Waste not.
1249911229	Different lure, same prey.
652662622	Let's change up the tactics.
1569869202	I don't like letting go of this.
300306984	We have fire.
1417903217	Burns real nice.
467872619	Here we go.
1411486888	Bout to get warm.
302668280	Lights out.
652052523	Can't have fire in here.
1457420380	Gnh... Dropped it.
1622118443	Damn it. Dropped it.
1264814354	Right, where was I...
931083611	Like I was saying.
401522522	Back to the matter at hand.
1858549859	All right, time to do inventory.
221990714	Let's see what we have left in here...
1378548511	Water hemlock. Seizures until respiratory failure. Beautiful.
826734633	Belladonna, a classic since ancient Rome.
282245438	White snakeroot. Painful, slow and steady.
584594638	Oleander. First your heart races, then it slows, then it stops.
965829499	The Rosary pea. A small dose is enough...
171706901	By the way, I am the only man alive who can know the contents of this bag.
1230028845	So... Which one will it be for you, my friend?
1789870355	Ready when you are.
1706662279	Quite the excitement.
524890511	Don't worry about me.
88413609	Let's continue, shall we?
268180849	Do we have to wait forever?
1247780825	Okay, let's get going.
1219250903	Now here's a thought.
2123319470	I'm all ears, darlin'.
315687347	The show goes on.
2072921681	Ready when you are, darlin'.
1383381796	These violent delights...
963953661	What can I do you for?
1858280251	Enough dilly-dallyin'.
1189424122	I'm all ears.
1156004235	Let's give them some trouble!
997793787	This is my kind of crowd.
1805510014	Everything quiet for now.
15802788	My my, what a sight.
336959792	Let's behave, for now.
764824042	No need to cause trouble just yet.
1601512113	The calm before the storm.
1155245369	Least the dress is nice.
1182695174	Gotta pay the office a visit.
1343011846	I'll get the deed and make my exit.
1451782882	Oh my. All this for me?
1890406092	Kate Higgins? I don't think so.
1082223844	We kicked the hornets' nest.
1299458567	I have to warn my uncle.
1481153901	Until death do us part.
1072916069	So much for flowers and champagne.
1222769325	High time we make our exit.
874441010	We're not finished here.
365062992	We'll show the DeVitt Company.
2114168605	If that damned train never came...
208234677	Should have changed into something warmer.
318068535	Your help is appreciated.
529234431	It's cold up here.
21936162	This far and no farther.
971948112	We'll put a stop to this.
914844976	The root of all our problems.
2057047496	Ugh... Yes, I'm here.
1729439451	Ugh... Not so loud.
2031986289	It's all a blur.
1775339868	Good grief, my head.
1448751618	What was in that bottle?
1977763561	What do they want with us.
1531541859	Harsh customs they have here.
635430846	Not exactly a welcome committee.
1569495315	I don't much like the hospitality here.
1210639349	This is downright barbaric.
1903070920	We should teach these guys some manners.
54106666	Do we have time for a stroll?
1853543106	Shame we're here for business.
966809227	New Orleans. Just like my mother's stories.
1156428242	I love this place already.
1513200660	This rain... Reminds me of home.
461790017	We have an appointment with Frank.
30484666	There's no halfway for the Devitt Company.
1061901531	Let's look for a chance to slip through.
1747135662	We stirred up the hive this time.
1654554408	You really want to pull this off?
1569558662	Just...don't, all right?
1034169539	I want to leave.
343043161	This ain't a discussion.
508980979	Can we get going?
512540043	I'm in no mood for talking.
1522725160	No meio do nada.
1540876363	I miss Colorado.
530657547	I just want to go home.
332021568	I'd kill for a hot bath.
1721307972	Look at this dump.
532392291	It's scorching.
271880329	Shall we, Mr. Cooper.
477595034	This mansion is something else.
1516341980	Let's not keep our host waiting.
1872820677	DeVitt has taste, I give him that.
1458677229	I get the feeling we're expected.
843192870	I'll follow your lead, John.
507827922	We'll finish this together.
61986203	This place has a certain charm.
1045937198	Yes, where to?
1786105161	Not gonna hold this all day.
917967702	Where do you want 'em?
2104279513	Uh huh... Where to?
771759895	Can't hold this all day.
182913030	Come now... Where to?
735059417	Quickly... My head's spinning.
1652511642	Ugh... Think I'm gonna be sick.
358989489	This is really heavy...
620512497	Damn heat...
1587355319	...Yeah?
354237353	Well, this is a bust.
229842641	Not much I can do.
407972274	All right Kate. Think.
2045930230	Damn it. I have to get out.
738078998	Done in one little second.
977718653	Charming.
1851590714	I'll get to it.
1923201489	Leave it to me.
1937383604	Just a moment.
927052031	Be there in a second.
835132948	I like what I'm hearing.
1385610568	Doesn't sound too hard.
1481481790	All or nothing.
1232449434	Child's play.
1786948368	Easy as pie.
72285543	Yeah yeah.
1685827545	Until the curtains fall.
1550537889	Till the end of the world.
1019434027	Let's take a gander.
864653061	I sense a plan coming up.
486486846	Let's have a look around.
690771917	Oh, this will be fun.
1213147799	No need to hide here.
2056917337	Free as a bird.
846219655	Oh, look at that!
138673515	What's over there?
1387730204	Oh, this is going to be fun.
1246083113	My pleasure.
1670670330	Let's be discreet.
448905550	Of course, yeah.
392538742	Let's hope they don't notice.
473128901	Here comes the runaway bride.
1487172680	I object this union.
1320575169	Quick, before he comes back.
695357504	Don't mind me.
753557832	Give the bride her space.
1865467636	I suggest we get moving.
2029317063	Exit stage left.
1737868768	I've had enough of weddings.
1863119789	Let's leave quietly.
1236909571	I say good riddance.
1125565533	Let's leave this mess of a party.
1382403595	This isn't over yet.
704377224	This is for Uncle Ian.
1624123869	They ain't gonna stop me.
1179320911	I'll settle this my way.
147496177	It's us against the world.
197855356	This is where it counts.
1740505865	I'm getting there.
291055982	Keep it together, Katey.
1813541356	Be right with you.
1971686413	All right, give me a moment.
1472391659	Don't worry, I'm coming.
9638538	I don't like cages.
228490985	Let's turn the tables.
113676065	These folk are in for a lesson.
660726503	They messed with the wrong girl!
557558137	They're in for a reckonin'!
376780566	You think they can swim?
1343138774	Off to business.
2147421968	Where could your friend be?
1882212706	I feel like a detective.
1265696742	On with the investigation.
1707205628	Eyes and ears open.
1229471021	Next stop, Pier 9.
1728849205	He won't stand a chance.
948972877	I got your back, Cooper.
386026856	Let's not be too hasty.
2126872838	Let's take him together.
1003485380	If I must...
398890799	For once...
1466311525	Enough with this.
1987657234	Don't push me.
1844302886	Ugh, let's just leave.
84275103	Let's push on.
1109549760	Can't be helped... 
1700132170	No way around it...
881975632	All right...
1165586264	Gotta move on.
1182038495	My my my.
1318065378	Let's enjoy this a bit.
1315819429	The grand stage awaits.
779994429	Let's work our charms.
1291065634	Ladies first.
2142301115	Let's not keep Frank waiting.
1391925987	The hunt is on.
402342032	Allow me, Cooper.
2074946168	Leave it to me, Cooper.
1623166882	Coming right up.
496270384	As quick as it goes...
1325023632	I'll get there somehow...
2110748125	You got this, Katey...
798372414	Heavy customer...
1885273166	Ugh, all right...
466958999	I'll manage...
1097499526	I can handle it...
1107343615	Mind helping out here...
1377988221	You can do it, Katey...
1964511647	Sure.
1723954028	Fine...
1563554498	Mhm... 
733202538	Come on... 
2085273548	I don't like this.
242197412	This will end in blood.
1593282978	A bit optimistic maybe.
167370488	I can try...
2094519254	Let's hope he's hungover, too.
921800830	My head says no, but oh well...
1710477248	This is a bad idea.
2037708763	It's gonna end badly.
1010221245	I beg your pardon?
432992996	I must decline.
879538203	Not really, no.
2090250482	That won't work.
1955584394	I can't see how.
1508144170	It's hopeless.
2079597850	Out of the question.
707482112	To hell with it.
1425364315	No can do, darlin'.
1641557646	That's not going to happen.
340475843	That won't work at all.
1148573691	No thank you.
1390804503	Let's try something else.
679257712	Sorry...no.
1827738306	My head's still a bit foggy.
1508247996	I don't think I can manage that now.
1485944239	I don't think so.
1865569410	No way.
986703905	Not like this, no.
1850790560	Maybe there is a shortcut?
57499880	Uh... I don't have the head for detours...
215288243	Ugh... I think the path is blocked.
1318555555	Am I seeing double or is that path blocked?
1302862243	Can't make that.
1031975555	Can't get through there.
568432083	That sounds like suicide.
169385146	Too much company in there.
546607681	We'd screw ourselves.
2022799657	We both know how this'll end, so no.
1808611176	I'd rather breathe some fresh air right now.
1461819240	I don't fancy company right now.
958568663	There's someone inside.
638190424	Sure ain't safe in there.
2015078312	It's locked.
2072014933	It won't open.
1252042839	No. It's locked.
989858365	It's locked.
1617931077	It won't open.
15011755	No. It's locked.
688296262	Locked.
1132645307	Won't open.
824250684	No, I need more time.
1207383684	Patience.
814126024	Almost ready.
959431809	Give me a break...
766350873	Sorry, gotta catch my breath...
1225353397	Patience.
1759891032	Gotta wait.
1048506751	Shit, I'm out.
1078935375	Looks like I'm out.
754217181	I don't have what I need.
402017396	No ammo. Great.
163783771	I'm out. Shit.
1633915536	And now?
1411920319	What do we do next?
549161645	So far so good.
627338091	All right, what now?
643025851	Works nicely.
572999759	All done.
612972696	Taken care of.
1513135500	No problem at all.
380083472	See? It's fine.
1133981523	Works like a charm.
414721411	Done and ready.
1231705115	That should do the trick.
1858120476	Lovely.
769673332	That went better than expected.
30463569	I'm on the road to recovery.
2146981015	That'll have to do.
679642602	It'll have to do.
1911693808	This better work.
395130537	So? What next?
985439663	Sorry about this.
651681702	Had to do it.
173686364	Should have known better.
1456024441	Violent ends indeed.
977304608	Tragic really.
1017245000	I do apologize.
849475662	Oh. My bad.
517414912	This turned out poorly.
523833572	Let's pretend that never happened.
850853633	It's done.
2120561687	Let's move on.
1371345850	No hard feelings.
2052102857	Hands off the lady.
1275906933	Go to sleep.
1260918108	You need a little rest.
2116376549	It never gets old.
65844907	That should knock 'em out for a while.
1861981220	I think you should lay down.
1774449643	Sweet dreams.
1395785862	Sorry. Kinda had to.
1112937803	Still got my aim at least.
1034167158	Whew. Got 'em.
1809840886	Damn company thugs.
195100532	At least that still works.
310277554	There's always more.
1564345485	...!
147460512	...! ...How rude!
2014272518	...! ...This wasn't how I pictured it.
391155267	...
1638672413	...!
1917055251	...!
930397428	...!
1052270846	...!
1919483398	...
1690941373	...
991378434	...Careful with that.
1667136463	...How rude.
1306860800	...That's a low blow from you.
1906678411	...Mind being more careful?
1200035356	...That didn't help my migraine.
1408873436	...This isn't funny!
362744205	...Goddamnit.
744569691	Ah! Hey!
673792462	What's the big idea?
2131119447	Is that really necessary?
1030618357	Curious feeling.
1689531370	Somebody's watching.
148219412	Is that her?
674560741	Out of my head, darlin'.
776871806	Who is she?
1918910746	Something's off about her.
601932199	She has a secret.
1844246658	Where have you gone?
1395122012	I'll find you someday.
1585686563	We'll come back here together.
849946144	How could he?
1793419407	I was wrong.
187192282	I have to get home.
258283	Look at him...
1149227829	Makes you forget.
14310999	I like it.
1994092423	Grand finale.
2110023124	All together.
1852015232	For John.
185961049	Come here...
1198038863	Easy now...
2090504760	All right then...
1938421956	Oh, my back...
890696360	Lift with your knees...
1686477158	Come here...
194213337	...!
76708393	All right...
1796816101	There we go...
1659157242	Done...
1426623472	Phew...
1682967462	There we go... Hah...
193931416	Done... Okay...
420660211	Phew... Glad that's over...
828947015	...!
1317680175	There...
449063833	hold still now.
1433016217	You better stay quiet.
1174254397	Nice and tight.
1885291362	Let's hope this holds...
165933546	Be glad you can lie down...
1443058351	Stay there.
717847113	On to the next.
1761715981	...!
991499024	...!
269029606	...!
1356702144	...!
201595858	...!
805283612	...!
2120483652	...
339127543	...
1077681253	...
1023814695	...
1138947851	...
712408993	...
389191739	I know where to hit.
427099378	I got good aim.
1664261576	Let's put 'em down.
2095840530	Sorry in advance, darling.
1451964675	Right where it counts.
703606557	Strap in.
273430395	I still got good aim.
475937262	Hmm, right where it counts.
1151252821	Out of my way.
1878605436	Another one!
1916783235	...!
2116645565	...!
1964411996	...!
950257491	I'll make them sneeze.
102466052	We have to be fast.
1190545045	On my mark.
1913501032	Ready and set.
58030253	Let's blind them for a second.
1315031385	Don't worry—it's harmless.
223504785	Just a harmless sneeze.
461128408	This is my kind of spell.
948423270	Still got these.
1506980286	Let's see about my aim.
2114110731	I still got vials.
1820308513	Be ready.
189626911	Don't dawdle now.
1641559203	Bon voyage.
608647102	Bless you.
363350903	Gesundheit.
1153277522	Best regards.
1018570693	Give it a try.
1911555171	Surprise.
130428194	Take one.
705266985	Sniff on this.
365383026	Go for it.
2046173492	On my mark.
1037675618	Hope that hits.
1800517617	Looks good.
39605622	Think that works.
106918267	Let's move it!
1002860428	Now's the time.
1297469761	Go!
443839895	Change of clothes.
1473999380	Let's put this on.
14549471	Just a minute.
2015558571	Let's change wardrobe.
1047003835	Just turn around for a minute.
1091247046	Some privacy please.
1957341210	I could use a change of clothes...
324330084	Eyes off the lady, got it?
951399271	Don't peek.
1595108438	You know the drill.
832262810	I think it suits me.
1666296008	How do I look?
473048294	Ready to go all in.
1223758613	Fits like a glove.
1319296243	At your service.
1638406639	Not bad, don't you think?
576486056	Ready for my entrance.
132539708	Please tell me I look convincing.
143713189	Ah, that's better.
1541462001	Here we go again.
598923841	Once more... 
442746241	Better find some clothes first.
1114639394	May I ask with what?
1966880744	I should look for a disguise.
1016397194	Get me something fresh. I'm all in.
820820370	Oh yeah... Let's find a disguise.
1691910552	I only have one set of clothes.
1010657167	I need a disguise first.
66991382	This will do nicely.
739092153	Love the color.
1652858069	I can work with that.
554143011	It's all I need.
158179416	This is perfect.
1027987776	Not too shabby.
180468776	Looks like the perfect fit.
312759435	Almost my colors.
1765608411	Yeah that'll do.
1328000473	Raunchy thing.
204105715	It's gotta work.
305564457	Let's dazzle them.
70898988	I'll play the charmer.
791004134	I'll work my charms.
1152256895	All eyes on me.
761927444	Time for my entrance.
1982189293	All right... Eyes on me.
1687911845	I'll give it my best.
1963125653	Hope I remember my lines.
1421936764	I guessed as much.
1548183629	My specialty.
1801616422	Hey darling...
1334074799	I was wondering...
1543296166	Hey there, good-looking...
1985225836	Let me ask you something...
679393532	My, aren't you handsome...
1961722208	You got a minute?
1587857238	Uhm, hi darling.
325937203	Hrm... You got a minute?
126791588	Hey... Hey handsome.
1370530946	Let me...let me ask you...
987114540	You got a minute...or three?
1829461259	All right, I got a question...
470359422	Hey you!
216961466	I got a question for you.
1200344626	Hey. I'm looking at you.
1631059046	You. Yes you.
1088628230	You got brains enough to talk?
1321922364	What do you think...
402309028	Maybe we could...
2060657383	Handsome fella like you...
1830809169	You're giving me ideas...
1476482307	Got any plans right now?
576581618	See anything you'd like?
1950379146	There's more where that came from.
880002684	This is nothing, darling...
271587996	Mind if I lean on you a bit?
1929328415	No... Don't worry, I'm fine...
986936502	I don't look tired, do I?
2071385736	Sorry darling. Rough night.
732043912	So... How's your day?
1089942960	Let's make this simple.
832466236	And another thing.
892417888	You won't get away that easy.
648944505	I'm not finished with you.
788277731	I know what you're thinking.
123778068	See you around, darling.
1314560198	Goodbye for now.
1266898621	Nice talking to you.
1984119015	See you later, sweetheart.
540417029	Let's do this again sometime.
2054638517	Have a nice day, handsome.
1900077739	Uhm, I have to go.
1805762260	Uh, yeah. Later darling.
1193551908	Right... Sorry, darling.
1604322273	That's all for now.
308272455	We're finished here.
879817673	I got better things to do.
1995117937	How rude.
19993541	Shame.
778388991	Suit yourself.
2053637367	That didn't work.
1899824715	It was worth a try.
2074287388	Ugh... How rude.
552665933	Fine... Suit yourself.
859789431	Damn it.
160715481	Well that didn't work.
480058997	I'll send them your way.
1505379178	I know what I'm doing.
1419350935	Well, let's lure them in.
1769684326	Watch and learn.
794024044	Let's give 'em a show.
1375464611	All it takes is a look.
1628697933	Wrapped around my little finger.
1576611824	I'll fool them, no problem.
1097583231	All it takes is a look.
1290667270	I'm the best.
1787044113	I'll fool them, no problem.
1146276303	Men are all the same.
1992257842	I'm getting tired of this part.
227699788	Let's get it over with.
28435139	Why don't we go somewhere private...
1745738872	Follow me, sweetheart...
127331203	Why don't you bring me to my room...
873146459	This way, darlin'...
937081373	Stay close behind me...
215443913	Come on. I know a place...
1081853101	Just you and me, handsome...
685622088	Don't miss your chance, darling...
977642088	Why don't you come over for a bit?
2138465537	This way... I think.
2098161898	Hmm, let's find a quiet place.
307252194	Why don't we...go over there?
1412980485	You like it rough? Come with me.
1427299912	Don't make we wait.
571595576	You better stay close.
296760591	I'll take that, thank you.
1445953918	Don't mind if I do.
962576577	That should be useful.
1811215141	Hmm. That's useful.
1952591630	Mhm, I'll take that.
1140395947	Got it. Let's go.
2075913982	I'll need that.
1758561620	I've enough, thank you.
1773814938	I've all I can carry for now.
1054888099	I'm not an ammo dump.
317785065	I'm full.
2130261075	I can't carry more.
583058565	Last resort.
1051398071	Better make this count.
1230429540	Elegant and discreet.
81751853	Easy to hide.
146878302	All right, plan B.
2125952053	Violent ends.
1611091643	I won't miss.
252225449	I got this.
750573089	Out of the way.
1303166160	Last shot.
1308464588	I'm almost out.
660048249	I'm light on ammo.
1745787008	Last one.
2007805245	Almost out.
1790233368	That's it. Show's over.
1453647277	That was my last.
1223945527	That's it.
2071901209	I'm out.
756818592	I feel revitalized. Thank you.
1812389110	Much appreciated, Doc.
1352375396	You got wonders in that bag.
608402710	Ugh... Reminds me of Uncle Ian's.
1047410195	You got a strong stomach, Hector.
1178224883	A bit too strong for my taste.
1565011293	Not bad. Reminds me of home.
1344645820	Thanks. I sorely needed that.
412495716	Keeps the spirits high.
2059132411	Whatever this is, it helps.
727566163	A bit unusual, but thanks.
489665932	What is this? It's good.
161830087	The fuse is lit.
1967034732	Time for a spectacle.
292659958	One explosion, coming up.
2027395105	Bon voyage!
1243911666	See you later!
18852996	Better watch out.
577456296	Somebody lose his purse?
624301229	Can't leave that here, can we?
549308147	Shame to leave that on the floor.
1040567359	Let me take care of you.
680620300	That's a hefty sum.
1574868414	There's the money.
1643724617	We might as well.
1488373483	Let's not get caught with this.
1759297442	Anybody interested?
1259678005	Here. Have a look.
1487560606	The line is cast.
416828610	Look. Money.
1625478641	Let's see if this works.
337028670	McCoy would love this.
1541852368	We have fire.
755470874	Nice flame.
2096201085	Here we go.
2065902765	Bon voyage.
43530637	Lights out.
469722583	Can't take the torch in here.
1866272784	Ouch. Dropped it.
1262741203	Damnit. Dropped it.
1625771850	Right, where were we...
181994049	I was just about to say.
1076070628	Picking up where we left off...
241174206	All right... Where were we...
1820144155	Like I was about to say...
225856436	Right... Back to the point.
1220715745	Where were we?
2051013985	Oho...what's this?
129821369	How charming. Reminds me of a little poem...
1576483147	Let me give you account of admirers I've had...
1166942897	Which will prove without doubt that most men are bad...
1620341749	Abe was a poet, said his love would not wither...
1945997035	But within just a week I caught him with my sister...
843191202	Barry was richer than all men I met... 
2062693396	But as deep as his pockets, as shallow the rest... 
947501601	Charly the trapper gave me pelts to impress...
1052134865	But warmth didn't help with the smell of his breath... 
1627612280	Danny the serpent kept avoiding the truth... 
1934003872	But sweetheart be certain, the most annoying is you.
1611803637	Heh, very funny.
1884065518	Are we really doing this?
1484745698	Sorry, sweetheart.  I'm not in the mood.
808909640	Fetch me a pick-me-up and we can talk, all right?
495658661	Guten Tag.
714829710	Okay, let's move it.
922483490	Sim, estou pronto para qualquer coisa.
1456299141	I could do this all day.
619396800	I got friends on the other side.
1280821733	You get scared easy?
172821210	Oh, I know what I'm doing.
1220634359	Let's cut to the chase.
745386213	Well, well...
1096298385	Uh huh?
836724243	Heh, look at you.
455563196	What's up?
1297570275	Set your eye on something?
1950080333	They ain't gonna notice us.
1063592293	We better behave around here.
609565279	No need to hide here.
545839574	Relax. We're safe here.
1260220584	We're all friends here, right?
1801040190	Slavers. What else is new?
727216055	No one's gonna be put in a cage.
2123964952	After this, it's back to New Orleans.
298129523	Nothing like New Orleans at night.
391591642	I know my way around.
626070730	Every place has its secrets.
639297125	DeVitt took over half the quarter.
1733099221	This place can go straight to hell.
1483495823	It's a nest, all right.
1715795038	DeVitt went too far this time.
850299631	See what DeVitt's capable of?
519918799	DeVitt likes putting people into cages.
100892671	Can we get going, please?
433769883	Shoulda packed a few nuggets.
460454085	Wonder how many mines Devitt has.
1913334314	So, this is where you end up.
1327090077	Let's hope your plan works, Sunshine.
518689819	DeVitt sure knows how to live large.
852130225	Fancy dress ain't my style.
339236802	I wanna see DeVitt's face.
199997219	Shame Doc ain't here.
1603221389	We'll take him down for good.
213210107	This place got history.
1141433182	So this is where it happened.
852681757	They knew we're coming.
1028910239	I love a challenge.
2117542934	Glad you're back, Sunshine.
780526017	Where to?
310821931	I'm waiting here.
1970943049	You wanna carry them?
1586978736	Let's drop this somewhere dark.
875472633	This is gonna be good.
1373149075	Yeah, I like that.
946438801	That's what I'm talking about.
1818062380	I'm already there.
375106021	Coming through.
1463267480	Let's make this interesting.
928614151	Let's see what we can do.
1291138300	Oh yeah.
394268050	Heh, nice.
679843745	Oh, I see where this is going.
1053526745	Not a bad idea.
941173767	I'll take care of it.
430808166	No problem.
1405739495	Let's be quick about it.
1077459486	Won't make a sound.
732821568	Just taking a stroll.
1157590785	Easy peasy.
1183229750	Let's not draw attention.
2108714373	Nice change of pace.
1800212601	Take a look around.
1597184644	Child's play.
1207487821	Time for a little payback.
937761858	Oh, I'm gonna enjoy this.
1071823802	I hate these guys.
264846364	Just a nice day at the river.
1943719329	Glad there's no gators here.
2079034413	Let me show you around.
189971941	Just gotta follow the clues.
338123914	The trail ain't cold yet.
94465682	hold tight, Wayne. I'm coming.
1143146030	Let's burn this place to the ground.
620887894	Can't get tired now...
1249330717	Gotta keep it together.
1260144330	Just a little farther.
636710225	We're gonna get outta here.
1488625972	Not gonna give up now.
1929519733	Not gonna die here.
284982281	Don't worry. Keep going.
985661758	I had enough of this place.
998176820	Let's entertain the guests.
398325729	Been looking forward to this.
141655482	Let's get DeVitt.
1465568110	Belly of the beast, huh?
1176569570	We're real close now.
1483848063	Let's pack this up.
829154899	Let's end it.
1855883930	This is for Cooper.
744500706	Off we go.
837940684	Sure, no problem.
1280486638	Easy.
1133196444	I got this.
42424190	Coming up.
163126714	Not so sure about this.
1281387733	I don't like where this is going.
970133390	This ain't gonna end well.
517525376	Nuh uh.
839026546	Not happening.
277351301	Think again.
626405494	Not doing that.
1465603173	No can do.
1033664241	There ain't no way.
1979602655	I don't see how.
1335663396	That's impossible.
1036318681	There's company in there.
859806228	It's not safe in there.
439249948	Forget it. It ain't safe.
1294512249	Locked, huh?
1292976346	It's locked tight.
1197692887	Nope. Won't budge.
1189830652	Not ready yet.
1549978633	It ain't ready.
445046105	Still gotta wait.
586165605	I'm out.
1440125400	Nothing left.
200110905	I got nothing.
1690838190	Finished.
1385068089	We done here?
904761970	All right, what now?
1775251552	All done.
1571810590	That'll do.
938924657	See you on the other side.
671036041	Like cutting herbs.
463928256	Go with Papa Ghede.
674215476	What's a little blood?
544103607	Oh, nasty.
436916236	Go to sleep.
1483089120	How adorable.
1958411762	Stay down, ya hear?
82122588	Who's next?
151943541	Aww, tired?
1548839610	That all you got?
1162137679	...!
718930136	...! Hey!
670654216	...! That really hurts.
1994905694	...
517850093	...No... Not yet...
1816613697	...!
156610241	...!
2029968742	...!
165766059	...!
2057969559	...
481090440	...
1516744320	...Yeah sure... Real funny.
1329375010	...Oh, I'm gonna get you.
1663065043	...Hey... Careful.
1645812927	...Oh, you want to be jinxed, huh?
1691141857	Gotcha.
242524463	Where to?
626775936	Ready. Where to?
951280403	Whew. Done.
1198499341	Let's put you here.
1285283961	Let's drop you off.
2136759918	Not heavy at all...
1884184145	Nice and tight.
320308234	Not a peep, got it?
1207475747	Too tight? Good.
923382311	...!
1538151701	...!
1377324306	...!
707188080	...
276522467	...
110218475	...
2031362824	Let's cut some weeds.
1157289741	Razor sharp.
1792824638	I'll send 'em to the other side.
1296679714	A soul for Papa Ghede.
1956181890	...!
1774737883	...!
2035379083	...!
577203227	Time to sleep.
2074291579	Let me at 'em.
485460720	Sweet dreams, coming up.
888374702	...!
1321257463	...!
2071021781	...!
123607556	Just a tiny prick.
1801719307	Let's stick a pin in them.
454889175	They won't feel a thing.
1129248243	Just a little blood.
928790262	That's one.
1265236183	That's another.
2043789239	Got one.
286750106	Got two.
1485265207	That one.
1040628537	And that one.
1724442411	Heh, barely felt it.
1619832780	Gonna go in myself.
1859572169	We're all connected.
872498356	Who's my lucky partner?
1790406456	What you don't do yourself...
1066427828	And now we just...
653938542	Just a little blood...
930706022	Don't need much...
414503893	One and the other.
2098572022	Just like sewing...
1377700400	Let's change things up.
284308200	That's much better.
72118034	Now I like it.
1207746109	Maybe like this?
41210787	Let's try something different.
1676982095	You ready, Stella?
216140776	You got some work to do.
1845121793	Hey Stella.
118162669	I got a task for you.
1109903659	Come on, go.
1160703492	Hurry up now.
247611732	Off you go.
464092178	Not bad, sweetie.
1123783526	Look who's back.
2082706861	Good job, Stella.
1427047199	Who wants to volunteer?
25618550	Let's make a friend.
81827236	This is gonna hurt.
163779763	I need a new puppet.
1540791117	I'll pull some strings.
1419141583	Don't get spooked now.
341591720	Going for it...
752888387	Here we go...
63333186	Deep breath...
4377793	Here goes...
1062250236	Listen.
1313429763	Listen up.
2065177712	Gotcha.
146785060	You're mine.
1589934152	All mine.
2134428731	Come to mama.
695404509	Let's get started.
654774778	Move.
1147675545	There.
1731813851	Go.
1196257580	Walk.
1545512649	Faster.
2038772205	Do it.
805008413	This one.
971476442	That's right.
277989932	No regrets.
836730851	Go for it.
1228782321	...! Back in action.
1238073356	...! Hope that was worth it.
720260906	...! Whew. All done.
1550753356	...! Shit that hurts.
641028331	...! Too strong...
575562138	...! He pushed me out...
624963726	...! That's a strong one...
637326336	Never doing that again.
10014101	I know the inside of my own head, thank you.
2049343867	That's not how it works.
1399245010	I got enough nightmares, thank you.
1267853701	Let's hear your thoughts.
1803793389	No harm in listening in.
1990184930	I'm a bit curious.
15203102	Could be interesting.
1614794442	Shit, I'm spent. Better take some jimson.
1676379491	What do we have here!
48842464	All mine.
2117087259	Just what I need.
552193462	Nah, I'm good.
358302127	That's more than I need.
716483205	I got enough for now.
1063981054	A little cure-all.
906752479	Always helps.
451365883	Best thing there is.
2099090885	Here's some jimson.
925185424	Easy, Sunshine.
1370602473	Heh, you really are a doctor!
614844196	Thanks, I guess.
639305164	Better already.
15023406	Ugh! Holy hell!
1321946249	What the... Ugh!
205647897	What is this?! Tar oil?!
1617486514	Just what the doctor ordered.
812359067	That'll do the trick.
1427776247	Back in action.
1307267463	Good as new.
873815517	Lighting the fuse.
2130811114	Gotta hurry here.
1374334792	Better decide fast.
1397376772	Fly.
519571502	See ya.
588536931	Take cover.
649032817	Lookey here.
367848240	Don't mind if I do.
1903272015	Lucky me.
2014483118	Finders keepers.
2036961015	Let's lure someone.
839487586	Like fishing, huh?
370675528	Who's gonna bite?
636651223	Money anyone?
323683247	We got fire.
1853956412	Torch ready.
788364589	Go.
538583848	Fly.
974757955	Lights out.
2070988801	Gotta lose the fire.
998814425	Shit. Dropped it.
1408005813	Fuck. Dropped it.
720245240	Where were we before...
1625285637	Like I was saying...
7662523	So, about that...
649615649	Mhhh... Stop it.
661354426	I said stop it. You think I don't know who you are?
1418039439	I'm losing my patience with you. Last warning.
786260379	Well, you asked for it.
211269754	Hgnn... There. You're mine. Now let's see...
175033187	Open the options menu.
860753893	Go to savegames.
1327277550	Press delete all... Do it. Now.
514413215	Oops... Look what you did, silly.
2036930682	Is it time?
1475892683	Eyes open, Johnny.
739688853	Tight as a bowstring.
621171003	Certo. Estou pronto.
596974803	Estou pronto dessa vez.
1308312152	I gotta get to Pa.
395666720	Pa needs me.
575611466	Pa went to the chapel.
608468872	Where to?
2141638710	This is...really heavy.
1699288412	Okay, uh, where to?
394982435	Sure. No problem.
2099790094	Leave it to me.
1189081317	On my way.
763245685	It's now or never.
557704481	Sure. Let's go.
1972136448	Right. On my way.
862236337	Sure thing.
1486685629	I got this.
1785287502	I'll get it done.
2027953958	Please be okay.
1785336322	I can do this...
1106567418	Gotta move.
1905492557	Now or never.
1611616462	Come on...
1193834096	On my way.
862746886	Yup... Leave it to me.
1703730525	Good spot.
557766959	Be right there.
2134395880	S-sure. No problem.
265383940	Hrgn... I got this.
1674904499	I don't see how.
835410211	I can't do it.
1970558397	That's gonna be a problem.
879504050	No can do.
1086406602	No way I can see.
905802931	Is there another way?
2135394769	Gotta find another way.
2125512474	There's trouble in there.
708369979	Shouldn't go in there.
1004098978	No. Bad idea.
2002224943	Locked.
1815445650	It's locked.
187308505	Won't budge.
2002792298	Gimme some time.

415864666	Back in business.
647044964	One shot.
635312242	South for you.
1752295524	Say hello to the devil.
1265775247	Adios, amigo.
332891646	See you in hell.
1393832655	Right, where were we...
771952356	So like I was saying...
22126072	Back to the point...
363767535	Marshal Wayne, at your service.
1496994253	Afraid I'm of little use right now.
1228969627	I'm listening, son.
1927766807	This place is a disgrace.
1267254988	Damn glad to be out of that cage.
2137125682	I'll make sure this won't happen again.
806067602	Where do you want him?
1476098744	I'd like to load off at some point.
799812792	Soon as you're ready, son.
1058460188	Right you are.
581642602	I like how you think, son.
1708215610	Let's get the hell outta here.
869066808	Consider it done.
138845997	I'll follow your lead.
850827794	We're gonna make it.
1962825353	I suggest we leave this place.
1694461279	Can't see no problem with that.
460075395	Good thinking.
1757940350	On my way.
176549620	Sure thing, son.
1008777889	I'll be there.
102502032	Não se preocupe comigo.
788869383	Certo...
78774169	No meu caminho...
1147696802	Está feito...
15303821	Nada disso ...
1446081837	Faz sentido...
121195731	Não pode fazer, filho.
820233215	Não vou fazer isso.
152324659	Eu não vou fazer isso.
1937627304	Fora de questão, filho.
2113992172	Não tem jeito.
827374949	O caminho está bloqueado.
648129397	Não vejo como chegar lá.
1732020754	Isso seria imprudente.
1919063967	Há problemas por dentro.
926615924	Não vai lá, filho.
962291400	Está trancado.
356274832	Não abre.
12718668	Muito bem fechado.
290316635	Nada mal para um cachorro velho, não é?
17692324	Mighty fine.
1281519187	Tudo feito.
525280163	Looks good if I may say so.
1926162010	Worked out pretty well.
747852420	Now it's right.
832587387	...!
2064956481	...! I'm taking fire!
655119952	...! Devils!
1608163689	...

2022916049	...
1806996776	Got 'em...
348336022	Heavy bastard...
298960712	...!
989236619	...! Gonna feel that tonight.
468085437	...! One fine deliver.
783279061	Now don't mind me, son.
609437565	You're gonna stay put.
600811666	Don't you move a muscle.
1029873556	...!
569979424	...!
129314070	...!

572060240	What were we talking about.
743624232	So, before we got interrupted.

139549372	That's right, run away!
443601189	Nothing. Well, all right then.
56811138	Keep your eyes peeled, you hear me?
219689660	This ain't over. You better be ready.
1258554962	Something's going on here. Stay sharp.
143100996	Careful. We got troublemakers here.
233000568	Eyes open. Someone's sneaking around.
253410658	Look! Up there!
114999996	How'd they get up there?!
74391369	Shit. They're above us!
1724059193	Oh yeah? Why don't you come over here?!

1148739280	I'm working with the law, asshole.
959713811	You're going down the slave hole!
94013792	Frank told us you'd make trouble.

397645827	Mr. DeVitt hates troublemakers!
1288422058	You're out of your league here!
1479601734	This is a private party!
139410904	Mr. DeVitt wants you gone.
1143442081	You'll never get to Frank!
22081791	Frank told us you'd come, dumbass!
1762081532	I won't go down without a fight!

160879338	You better not be in there!
992869511	Think you're clever, huh?

1601273853	Ah! You're in there, right?
2130902809	I know you're in there!
1731839353	Did someone come through here?
2018501154	Maybe they went through here?
1083790060	I'm headin' inside.
1968218570	Are you behind this door, sunny?
548714726	I got the master key, asshole.
2141033609	What's behind door number one?
548291315	Nothing. Oh well.
1727715797	Must have imagined it?
1534380886	Shit... Back to work.
832297329	I should cut back on the whiskey.
1490223392	Maybe just the wind.
1390990711	Fuck this. I got better things to do.
1642195416	Nope. Nothing. Fucking waste of time.
800172748	Forget it. Not my problem.

1296601831	Hello?
421170061	Are you hiding from me?
131095827	Come on, I'm not in the mood.

2103400716	What a shithole...
1815827188	Don't trust these folks...
1363298120	What would it be like to be rich?
119344786	It's the wedding day at last.

570557686	I'm fucking soaked.
2042360926	Something's going on.
1530925514	Don't like the new ones.
1998337660	The heat's killing me.
184791831	No meio do nada.
1458548270	We're gonna get them.
538629131	Shit, it's hot.
1772219422	Double the pay, he he.
2093659069	Who needs Frank.
298655280	This is the life.
1789775162	Just like the good old days.
648000169	How's it going?

144544898	...Don't ask.
1066043809	When do we ride?
1740931131	Dunno. Soon maybe.
1375418294	Hey, where's the whiskey.
1780416712	Ran out yesterday.
345189728	They sent an escort this time.
1219188071	Heh, well that didn't help a lick.
205268684	You see Big Ann?
260125397	She's up on the plateau.

1660140081	Not yet. Stay sharp.
1107573045	Any sight of the killers?
1149419162	Nope. I'm glad.
110752159	Big ranch, huh?
1551734543	Yeah. Biggest I've ever seen.
606466086	Had to rain, huh?
489833113	You made of sugar or something?
1631096019	You all right out here?
1410344561	Think I'm catching something.
1370099998	You hear about Flagstone?
1848872954	Yeah. Fucking shithole.
489468895	You think he was alone?
1883688680	I'm not sure. 
1989334368	You see the guy?
1354439957	Yeah. Fucking bounty hunter.
1858462346	Any idea what's going on?
1936445947	My money's on swamp witches.
269945475	You think it's true? The devil?
1029146633	Hell, I don't wanna think about it.
148340071	You think we can have the girl?
1755549648	The boss'll cut your dick off.
840192405	What's taking so long?
2144854809	We still got a few stragglers.
648151727	You got your orders?
1933916278	Sure. It's all up here, I think.
36917020	Dragon's Den when we're done?
1125783416	He he, count me in.
129090878	You hear about the swamp witches?
1629622092	You believe in that crap?
2112582582	What happened to Baxter's crew?
1359094338	Last catch was trouble.
1641774706	Wonder what's on that ship?
1133165006	Things above our pay grade.
370947510	What's the matter with Frank?
1212097843	He's brooding on something.
2050328114	What's with the new guys?
1247060918	Frank said there'd be trouble.
460043815	You hear about New Orleans?
1765158267	No.
1082462987	You think they'll come through here?
85149765	DeVitt sure thinks so.
1472165189	Frank wasn't kidding about these guys.
47033907	We'll get them.
895861040	Nervous around rich folk, huh?
1946833463	Shut up.
1784476798	Can't believe we'll get double pay.
1892693736	Yeah. Frank's missing out.
1949184865	You think they'll come?
1240553083	Frank says they will.
2006762853	Reminds me of the good old days.
537414759	Yup. Still fucking hot.
683101355	Apparently it was the bride who shot him...
1981160745	Shit, and that their wedding day. We been told find her.
963204999	Didn't think Miss O'Hara had it in her...
286550826	She's gotta be hiding somewhere. Keep your eyes peeled!
1815664110	You see anything suspicious?
554723004	No, nothing. The bride's still loose, he he.
106895112	That bitch. She really shot the mayor?
1557008734	Yeah. Keep looking! She still has to be here.
442175884	Shouldn't be hard to spot her in a wedding dress.
1377363226	We ain't seen her. Let's keep watch.
1040101000	Shot him with that old shotgun in his office.
1493221992	Damn, she's got fire. Shame we gotta kill her.
1681128826	Miss O'Hara is on the run! Keep your eyes open.
109149626	She really shot Higgins? Wow...
2005113553	Red hair, wedding dress covered in blood... 
2049671442	Ain't no mistaking her. Shoot on sight.
1317676987	We gotta find her. Higgins is dead, goddamnit.
1264278637	Yeah, she's gonna pay for that.
161309620	I tell you, it ain't gonna end well.
274853156	Yeah, I heard about that.
1435947562	Leave it to the professionals.
755395228	That's what I'm talking about.
1655396630	Don't tell anyone, okay?
1704024100	What about the other one?
1328969336	Doesn't matter in the long run.
128445364	Just listen for a second.
1616548851	Sure, but what happens now?
162289897	Don't worry. I've seen it before.
302085781	Not sure I'm following you here.
1378409662	Can't believe I missed that.
340471911	That's the difference right there.
726541011	He he, told you so.
2018315010	That can't be true, right?
247837793	You better believe it, buddy.
1612396731	Yeah, but that ain't nothing new.
698043621	You hear all kinds of things.

918882158	I'm gonna throw you down the cliff.
2076994683	You'll never get through the front gate.
156489526	You think you're smart, huh?!
215603118	The company owns your ranch now.
105389863	We're gonna burn this place to the ground.
634504323	You had your chance to give up!
1763686719	You're those troublemakers from Flagstone, aren't ya?
1090999474	You're on DeVitt Company property.
2102258360	You sure didn't come with the train.
161046953	You're gonna make nice target practice.
910429965	We got your daddy. Better give it up.
970401558	Oh, Frank's gonna like you!
2084436998	Come out, kid! I don't bite.

2055624551	In the name of the law, show yourself.
1126043696	You know what we do with troublemakers?!
80609753	Think you're getting away?! Think again!
672977670	You're more trouble than you're worth!
1830955182	We could have got a good price for you!
374399780	I'm gonna drown you in the fucking river.
1690364394	This is DeVitt Company business!
1512358348	We don't like spies around here.
836955037	Wrong place, wrong time my friend.
130585470	We got a nice cage for you!
1964699724	You came to the wrong swamp!
186195665	I'm gonna feed you to the gators.
2118249060	Welcome to the Queen's Nest, asshole.
74362456	Thought you'd slip through, huh?!
223465408	This is official DeVitt Company business!
592700306	This district is off limits!
123907633	I'm working with the law, asshole.
1983109371	You're going down the slave hole!
193038502	Frank told us you'd make trouble.
1766630638	No one ever escaped from here.
227582681	You belong to DeVitt now.
1835775045	We're gonna bury you alive!
2132624997	You're gonna die in this dump!
1483293184	If you're waiting for the train, forget it.
2037151594	Train ain't gonna stop here. Give it up!
674906952	Mr. DeVitt hates troublemakers!
1156668696	You're out of your league here!
1963674029	This is a private party!
1812469583	Mr. DeVitt wants you gone.
1354053649	You'll never get to Frank!
1343514226	Frank told us you'd come.
670133717	I won't go down without a fight!
1575933026	I killed my share of bounty hunters!
2089844001	Is someone hiding in there?
2090102848	All right, I'm coming in!
358797563	You better not be in there!
1368781384	Think you're clever, huh?
42740192	Did that shrub just move?
269222431	I'm gonna drag you outta there.
1360203375	Ah! You're in there, right?
527376225	I know you're in there!
888019018	Did someone come through here?
734157328	Maybe they went through here?
1567086874	I'm headin' inside.
1609193773	Are you behind this door, sonny?
461736540	I got the master key, asshole.
601379350	What's behind door number one?
1247568758	Nothing. Oh well.
1412981802	Must have imagined it.
1886834519	Shit... Back to work.
2067284352	I gotta cut back on the whiskey.
1241476257	Maybe just the wind.
1227591786	Fuck this. I got better things to do.
1374247182	Nope. Nothing. Fucking waste of time.
379096336	Forget it. Not my problem.
1768732506	Don't matter. They're gone.
1533526477	Gone. Well shit.
1801000726	Just remembered I don't care.
1004651580	Tch... Who am I kidding.
1832153080	Fine. Just don't come back!
542570394	I'm gonna get you next time!
1236353381	Okay then! Stay the fuck away!
634337103	You got lucky this time!
1958827406	What the hell am I doing?
39000782	Fucking jokers.
1236100538	Shit. I was all in for a fight.
292217397	Goddamnit, every time!
1425141375	I'm too tired for this shit.
1893246916	Fuck this, I'm not going for a walk.
1404928142	Too much walking.
279281873	I ain't going all the way there.
2124278582	I ain't going in there now.

259153656	Can't see a way over there.
1937170345	Yeah, that's too much trouble.
1953083127	I ain't getting paid enough for that.
658479864	Hello?
40954105	Are you hiding from me?
1938364510	Come on, I'm not in the mood.
781427408	Maybe wandered off.

1387874504	Oh, this is wild.
1700291183	How the hell did that happen?
1318137618	Can't do nothing here.

1274377328	All's quiet.
2139068928	Nothing wrong here.

1165259692	Big Ann's smart.
964683128	I want my share.

1323469637	I'm fucking soaked.
255514242	Something's going on.
1237389301	Don't like the new ones.
65254281	The heat's killing me.
930410374	No meio do nada.
1453006084	We're gonna get them.
1923428619	Shit, it's hot.
890210459	Double the pay, he he.
644889805	Who needs Frank.
876716575	This is the life.
2046013742	Like the good old days.
1360798310	How's it going?

1911675148	Dunno. Soon.
1120661080	Hey, where's the whiskey?
1999341414	Ran out yesterday.
1923127956	They sent an escort this time.
1893526892	Heh, didn't help.
903666081	You see Big Ann?
2104919964	She's on the plateau.
815716627	Townsfolk make any trouble?
1766370551	Ha, you kidding me!

2127926880	You see that bride's dress?
981894021	It's her big day.
148601268	You see anything?
780151102	Not yet. Stay sharp.
649828033	Any sight of the killers?
1878894272	They ain't getting through me.
2047179372	Big ranch, huh?
475254796	I've seen bigger.
284886531	Had to rain, huh?
934623264	You made of sugar or something?
1784400669	You all right out here?
791360492	Think I'm catching a cold.
444852758	You hear about Flagstone?
1362910743	Yeah. Fucking yokels.
2000504381	You think he was alone?
264087932	Can't be sure, so stay sharp.
986757467	You see the guy?
821083640	Yeah. Fucking bounty hunter.
2124300031	Any idea what's going on?
1956349303	My money's on swamp witches.
1552781195	You think it's true? The real devil?
214174165	I don't wanna think about it.
1207288509	You think we can have the girl?
1210674820	The boss'll cut your dick off.
1788691191	What's taking so long?
1617630769	We still got a few stragglers.
463046317	You got your orders?
142183412	Sure. It's all up here.
1736614022	Dragon's Den after shift?
1816157124	He he, count me in.
809606388	You hear about the swamp witches?
1748943522	You believe in that crap?
1032767443	What happened to Baxter's crew?
74853611	Last catch was trouble.
892812748	Wonder what's on that ship?
269995650	Things above our pay grade.
1683253584	What's the matter with Frank?
1084552811	He's brooding on something.
233433875	What's with the new guys?
1307966936	Frank said they could be trouble.
1487915946	You hear about New Orleans?
1601427539	I hear all kinds of stuff lately.
692845507	You think they'll come through here?
286779195	DeVitt sure thinks so.
113362329	Frank wasn't kidding about these guys.
1951702357	We'll get them.
178772890	Nervous around rich folk, huh?
1209879289	Shut up.
943622691	Can't believe we'll get double pay.
74774866	Yeah. Frank's missing out.
554084832	You think they'll come?
1189233292	Frank says they will.
2018112649	Reminds me of the good old days.
1534366620	Yup. Still fucking hot.
1060227886	Apparently it was the bride who shot him...
1496535863	Shit, and on their wedding day. We gotta find her.
921839085	Didn't think Miss O'Hara had it in her...
996816712	She's gotta be hiding somewhere. Keep your eyes peeled!
936095408	You see anything suspicious?
201725294	No, nothing. The bride's still loose, he he.
117582150	That bitch. She really shot the mayor?
1251047427	Yeah. Keep looking! She still has to be here.
540585923	Shouldn't be hard to spot her in that wedding dress.
1353914458	We ain't got her yet. Let's keep watch.
1028405653	Shot him with that old shotgun in his office.
1611919943	Damn, she's got fire. Shame we gotta kill her.
1854882121	Miss O'Hara is on the run! Keep your eyes open.
1234296461	She really shot Higgins? Wow...
7834109	Red hair, wedding dress covered in blood... 
467478339	Ain't no mistaking her. Shoot on sight.
966422218	We gotta find her. Higgins is dead, goddamnit.
1495710882	Yeah, she's gonna pay for that.
2109723010	I tell you, it ain't gonna end well.
1509985887	Yeah, I heard about that.
2068299874	Leave it to the professionals.
935803957	That's what I'm talking about.
1861227825	Don't tell anyone, okay?
913637605	What about the other one?
856588734	Doesn't matter in the long run.
315666041	Just listen for a second.
566457308	Sure, but what happens now?
1884479842	Don't worry. I've seen it before.
1713338976	Not sure I'm following you here.
713366497	Can't believe I missed that.
1175114786	That's the difference right there.
721976027	He he, told you so.
1793134620	That can't be true, right?
211114732	You better believe it, buddy.
1448045880	Yeah, but that ain't nothing new.
1439857118	You hear all kinds of things.
1207545225	Guess times are changing.
2134374463	That's news to me.
1303882750	Now, where was I?
939821502	Lost my thought... Ah, yes.
1700226097	As I was saying...
1752769007	Right, where were we?
1203340672	Back to the point...
1638297584	You ain't getting through here.
20858982	Nothing here for you, buddy! Piss off.
1283621406	You got no business here. Move along!
329956998	You better not try getting past me.
816115036	No one's getting inside.
1046898035	Stay back. There's nothing to see here.
1359674749	We got a problem here? Stay back.

1671762905	Here and no farther, understand?

90172133	We got ourselves a runaway!
182084477	You're not getting away, precious!
1900321037	This is an off-limits area!
261030710	Mind your own business!
324871433	Stealing company secrets, eh?!
2107549895	You ain't with the company!
272344768	They'd pay a nice sum for you!
1494490460	Look! Fresh meat!
563174000	We'll lock you up for good!
1636202382	Nobody's allowed through here!
1687065456	The district's under curfew!
429992108	Who let you out?!
392599331	Tired of digging, huh?!
1142734848	You won't leave this place!
2058003885	Your little excursion ends here!
563141744	Thought we let you get away?! 
1137920410	DeVitt wants you dead!
1724949525	You're not on the guest list!
544625261	You won't bust this party!
1339131158	Snuck in, did you?
455603580	That's not allowed!
1785179457	Shit! It's them!
1604851240	It's Cooper's gang!
2030696735	You ain't getting me!
1270946047	You came all this way to die?!
984117056	I see you, cowboy!
1436082882	It's Cooper! Quick!
1621166818	It's the big one over here!
1595709291	Hector! He's here!

1446291070	Stop where you are, kid!
1997286731	Darn! The marshal!
1736924114	The marshal?! Weren't you locked up?!
447181357	hold on...who's behind me?
1744777944	Wait...is someone behind me?
629612310	Somebody's nearby. I can sense it...
2081350342	You touch me, I shoot you!
1085021774	Ouch! What was that?
88277665	What?! Back off!!
533726951	Whoa! Sneaky bastard!
1103717288	So this is where you were hiding!
464067447	Feeling smart, hiding in here?
157864457	Hiding? Not with me!
1031683945	What's a nice thing like that doin' here...?
293571649	Must be something valuable inside...
365720673	That's a good find...
1962993431	Interesting... Who lost that?
1677762865	Finders keepers!
1235277528	Huh? What might be in there?
957586585	That's a big purse!
117011912	Oh? Interesting!
2133672857	Aha... Let's have a look.
2131105379	Hey girl, you all right?
303774637	What's with her, lying there?
601437564	Wake up, buddy!
391515428	Somebody knocked him out!
252305833	Get up, lazyhead!
1520315910	You all right?
2126586263	The traitor! I'm sure it's him.
1909161177	Looks like he's the one.
568649070	Didn't get far, did she?
1600531337	So it was her. I saw that coming!
327484984	The traitor! Got knocked out!
1155127176	Over here. I got myself the traitor.
599605479	So it was you! Never liked you anyways.
1984096465	There you are! Serves you right!
444468657	He won't do no harm anymore.
1364435435	Let's leave him here for now.
66148450	Let's deal with her later.
1471995716	Serves her right, traitor. Stay here for now.
301805015	Gonna deal with you later.
120068481	All nice and tied up!
2056311378	Who tied her up?
782512593	They tied her up!
559367249	Damn. Hogtied him like a hog!
1566878282	Somebody tied him up!
1705783842	Dirty son of a gun, tied up one of us!
276402003	Wait, I will untie you.
598695974	Huh? Where did she go?
2092282829	Hm, wasn't she here before?
2130714936	Hm, just left her for a minute...
81298630	Huh? Wasn't he here before?
222160321	Why do all men leave me?
1231440652	Ugh, where did he go now?
493360499	Hey, don't leave the dirty work to me!
296286439	Very funny... Stop hiding.
877599471	Okay, that's not creepy at all...
2095817478	Hey, wake up, sleepyhead!
2085200119	Got a good sleep? Get off your ass!
1629890106	There you are! Lazy bastard!
1541838480	There you go. 
1587524749	You saw who tied you up?
1512968475	There was something!
400357968	Huh?
872496089	You hear that?
1512246792	For fuck's sake! Who the hell did that?
810210413	Playing tricks on a lady?
2074638541	Ouch! That hurt!
464896526	Gunshots! What's going on?
46871952	Gunfire!
1429347328	We are under attack!
968083639	That was a mighty big bang!
774498188	Dynamite? What's going on?
428948956	They got dynamite! Careful!
1923561638	Huh? Who's there?
1716641214	I heard something!
575083274	Show yourself!
1674523929	I'm coming to get you!
1334312422	You find that amusing, huh?
151279783	Okay, that was it for you!
1492793541	Huh? Something's up...
1438946274	Strange noise...
1358746264	Never heard that before...?
683754922	What am I doing?
1828598738	Never mind.
1505163385	This is stupid.
1006025375	Playing hide and seek?
1164573094	Just wait. I'll get you...
299558125	You gotta be somewhere...
631035378	You're here. I know it.
339452515	I won't go easy on you.
1552986833	I passed out...? No, somebody was here!
1517437695	Damn my head... I'll get you!
1970926035	I'll show you...
1601189182	When I get my hands on you...
648970443	That's not how you treat a lady!
774025025	Can't hide forever.
1537587768	Come out, you coward!
2133963949	What're you tryin' to prove here?
4006806	Aren't we a little old for that?
5573205	Come on, don't make this worse than it is.
2121149188	Do me a favor and give up now.
1519623571	You can't play tricks on me.
776109187	Come on, I'm getting bored!
1171542764	You won't make it far.
40374583	Spare us the time and give up...
278431273	You gotta come out at some point.
372639405	Come out, you chicken.
255397480	Wait until I find you...
1513770214	I'll get you, I promise.
1162281689	Damn cowards...
4052396	You scared of me or somethin'?
1336973318	Keeping a woman waitin'. Why you got no manners?
2045956463	Have a little self-respect and fight a lady!
1172847170	You wanna play cowboy, kid?
1232002198	You're vulture food, kid.
1786509530	You got guts, I give ya that.
117686383	I ain't gonna hurt ya, promise!
1177441163	You should have run.
224694172	Missed yer chance to keep quiet!
1564626914	Stay away from our loot!
1344683649	We're Big Ann's gang! You better run!
267236721	You picked a fight with a company gal.
1139045779	You better leave Flagstone before I find you.
1313728608	We're gonna hang you from the church bell.
343351255	Yeah, you go hide yourself in the mud...
104708902	Nasty thing, spoiling a wedding!
2108494088	If Higgins hears about this we're in trouble!
1498495943	Higgins won't go easy on ya!
661342927	Higgins's not going to let you off lightly!
1381150478	Pretty rough way to blow off a wedding!
329401955	You'll never make it out of here!
860976323	It could have been such a nice day...
490179201	Wouldn't have married him either. But that's no excuse!
622464132	This place is ours now. You better run...
917893438	The company owns your ranch now.
2100439523	What're you tryin' to prove here?
1287848403	Come on, don't make this worse than it is.
1919776286	You're the guys from Flagstone, aren't ya?
1160121113	You're on DeVitt Company property.
1838429000	What's your business here? Sabotage?
1665526397	Dirty vandals, come out!
790672111	You don't want us to hurt your daddy, do ya?
807179287	Oh, Frank's gonna like you!
85462254	Come out, kid! I don't bite.
1988259407	Bet Daddy's proud of you...
1785647156	Come out, ye devils!
877661728	Show yourselfs! Hands up!
443529872	This is a lawful town! Give up!
1589099088	The law's on our side!
1010355266	Keep hiding and the gators might bite ya.
950927763	Come on, don't spoil us the good catch.
719572044	Hope you'll drown in the river!
648019389	We still got your friends, remember?
411701309	This is DeVitt Company business!
1240217714	Don't mess with the DeVitt Company...
1564344763	Wrong place, wrong time my friend.
744476612	We got a nice cage for you!
905694226	Dangerous place for sneaking around!
292523126	You're ready for a nice cage!
199043485	Nobody leaves the Queen's Nest!
1228481770	If we shoot ya, it's your own fault!
256714908	This is official DeVitt Company business!
2104741658	This district is off limits!
557211357	If we shoot ya, it's your own fault!
1454907918	This mine will be your grave.
124452350	Frank warned us 'bout you!
1057339553	No one ever escaped from here.
407233368	You belong to DeVitt now.
2814878	This is the end of the line!
797965340	We've been waiting for you!
1500190365	If you're waiting for the train, forget it.
1836482292	Train ain't gonna stop here. Give it up!
354349021	DeVitt will be very angry at ya...
901409971	Something tells me you ain't been invited.
54236550	This is private property!
1553926137	Disturbing the guests, are we?
2029206561	Come out... Frank's longing to see ya...
779333142	Frank told us you'd come.
963638381	I won't go down without a fight!
1172043448	Come out... Frank's wanting to see ya...
475701054	Maybe in this scrub...
263080542	Hiding in the bushes, huh...?
1836673666	You better not be in there!
1491255581	Did I hear leaves rustle?
525330023	Did that shrub just move?
1513448789	I'm gonna drag you outta there.
1474791609	I bet you're in there...
893764618	I know you're in there!
1492305414	Maybe inside?
2102207124	May I come in?
831841175	Maybe you are...in here?
1442960160	Hiding somewhere warm and cozy, huh?!
378476087	This would make a fine hideout...
1668953123	You thought nobody would search in here?
35357383	Uhh... This is too frustrating...
1413591519	I got better things to do.
1999014576	Nothing... Well shit.
1659373676	Guess they're gone now.
548845493	I'm not in the mood for games...
1964248036	Fine, you win. This time...
529070869	I'll save that bullet for another time.
124655095	Forget it. Not my problem.
153534345	I better get back to my post.
799844223	Damn... Lost track of them.
792565262	A waste of time...
111114383	Afraid of me? Good. Stay away!
748899062	Come back when you're man enough.
1396987210	There's no one here. 
355815322	Well, this is getting boring.
641021955	Now I think about it...what do I care?
676376728	I win this round.
890907453	Go to hell... I'm outta here.
575676729	Oh, I hate this job!
1540844343	I'm off. This is ridiculous.
340184824	The coast is clear it seems.
1031427190	That's a bit far.
1847475966	Well, I'll just stay here.
1734049054	Ain't in the mood for a walk.
758232536	I'm doing fine outside.
2099038314	I'm gonna stay outside.
954929287	Can't go in there right now.
1687693194	Ain't in the mood for a walk.
580718874	Got too much to do in here. 
243326058	I better stay in here.
2060638451	Now I think about it...what do I care?
173467511	Yeah, that's too much trouble.
979385948	I ain't getting paid enough for that.
473034729	Helloooo? You still around?
1132532949	Whatever it is that I did now, I am sorry.
1064448566	Very funny, hiding from me...
1822116172	Hm... Went to see a man about a dog!
1763957788	Will be back in time I guess.
1524028109	Okay fine. Be that way.
1214802687	Have you been here all along?!
1462209778	Hey. I was worried, you know.
2041502425	There you are! Don't leave all of a sudden!
549996112	Oh hell!
68296730	What a shitty day...
623484324	Damn! What else can go wrong here?!
21339042	Holy cow!
737086831	This ain't looking good!
1825753320	Too late...
1113146002	How could that happen all of a sudden?
1993530896	Something's fishy about this accident...
543087491	Damn... Bad time for something like this.
1858013314	No way...
922922847	Can't do nothing here.
450873545	Better leave before I get to clean this up. 
293736966	Can't be helped. Gotta go back.
1513177208	What a mess...
424528151	They should pay us more for doing this...
289444806	Well, not my problem.
2143908574	I don't like this. Someone's out there.
247139717	Shit. This better not happen to me.
716647305	Damn O'Haras. Guess they set up traps.
1231408022	...
776539660	...
1634478446	...
1639375325	...
966368762	...I was just resting my eyes!
1077359445	...Hu-stop! I'm wide awake!
947253814	...Huh... Who's there?

767507631	Don't think so...
19156130	Better not.

1510286891	And done...
53308589	Like that?
77441603	I got this.
1605726962	Uhh...hands are shaky today...
541789997	Steady... Steady...
326576794	Just...takin' aim...
1470070800	Just a little...little shot.
1789015534	There... There... Easy!
1457969274	Stay still...please...
214939415	...
1440215797	...
2015590945	...
651977718	...
1671377371	Huh? Did I just pass out?
721971	Oh, wait... How did I get here?
1096803553	Hm? What was I doin' here again?
1146240195	Ah...my head. What happened here?
1356407361	The hunt is on.
1402749410	Find 'em before they run off!
930510579	They won't get far. Spread out!
636774531	All right, let's get 'em for good!
1394194207	Corner them! Search everywhere!
850030295	We're gonna find every last one of you!
844741391	Okay, fellas! This time we get 'em!
1190724277	They can't fool us. Hunt them down!
622448319	They were here a second ago. Can't have gone far!
275848141	Split up, everybody! Go get 'em!
2128860172	Keep looking! We gotta find them!
690966405	They can't hide forever. Go search everywhere!
1954485090	We surrounded you. Come out!
1757339498	Search every nook and cranny!
324630781	You're outnumbered! Give up!
1030965119	Give up, cowards! We have the upper hand!
1811260869	They are here! I know it!
2074334905	Can't have come far. Keep lookin'!
584128661	Come on! We can't let them escape. 
773253327	Keep your guns ready. They're here!
591010557	I know they're here. Keep looking.
316939228	Keep it up! We almost got 'em!
1545641688	Forget about it. We'll get 'em another time.
541047470	Stop searching. They're far away by now. 
1977821627	Tss... It's no use. Let's go back.
1111021564	Too late... They're not here anymore.
1074666368	Good job, fellas... We drove 'em off.
1782283089	Can't find 'em... Let's retreat for now.
621130926	Not wastin' more time on this. Let's go back, fellas.
1151332604	This is taking too long! We got work to do!
1478727885	Seems like they're gone. We drove 'em off...
319944193	They ain't coming back. Good job.
440169159	Nice try, sweetie. But you're not my type.
1319030304	Go and hunt somewhere else!
1704614934	You really that desperate?
1981616206	Come on, you can do better.
306702713	Gotta stay at my post, darlin', ya know...
2087661599	Sorry, girl. Grow a beard—then we might talk again.
503081441	Not today, darling.
103687019	Sorry, I'm not in the mood.
936252275	You lucky bastard.
1493741192	She's too good for ya!
1569485127	Yeah, yeah, you go have fun...
937947480	Oh, darlin'. He's not worth the trouble, believe you me.
543237631	Oh no you don't.
379951664	She's just playing with ya.
1502583674	Don't let her fool you.
1736294830	Sir?
1752780677	Me, sir?
1852590586	Yes, boss?
613753461	You mean me, boss?
648156018	Of course, sir.
355452095	Got it, boss.
1462931374	Absolutely, sir.
1993383671	Sure thing, boss.
1412084574	Okay, boss.
713525309	Thank you, sir.
45310249	I'll remember your words, sir.
307941249	God, what an asshole...
1219650760	Ouch. Damn pests.
494481073	Damn girl... Wastin' your life out here.
1313845231	Ugh... My boot has a hole...
1448544098	Any second...something could happen... Nah...
1187644815	Mmmh...if I ever get a pay raise...?
336705905	Uh...isn't it time yet?
76388864	All quiet...
371610767	Hmm... I wonder where all the nice guys work.
244543861	Ouch... My butt hurts...
909080414	Will get a nice, hot bath after work.
536500147	...
951235584	...
298658154	...
933788749	...
197621312	...
277092472	...
1747978225	...
253312710	...
1692263038	...
1955342147	...
1340414431	Cheers!
1937391094	Heh, bottoms up!
169360161	Down the hatch!
173424520	Here's mud in your eye!
361402352	Makes me nervous, Frank bein' all happy...
160221383	The heat is killin' me.
1973442478	I wish I had Big Ann's guts.
2031957503	What to buy from my share...
963939856	Ugh... Only farmers hangin' out here.
1958851301	The brothel seems interesting.
1642252753	I wonder what the dress cost...
720184568	Cake lookin' delicious...
249329509	Ruinin' such a day. Evil folks.
232063672	Did someone catch 'em yet?
1332015414	Mud and rain... The city was nice.
1500288334	Hm... Lot to do on a ranch like this.
1052794719	This weather might cost me a toe.
1633331465	Can't shoot with cold fingers...
1608287012	Gotta keep my eyes out.
1322282685	Frank's pissed.
468820244	Finally something happens here.
457561374	Wonder if they are still around...
1497419997	Damn witch. Creepin' me out.
1616442860	Wonder if I see that cat again.
2100590949	Ah... Big city...
912066454	Heheh... I'd be a good dancer as well...
605131499	Hope the gators stay where they are.
1264991297	Uch—another swampfly!
2115139982	The dogs are restless.
1154348555	Damn this rain...
114624442	Don't like the new ones.
1034866284	Ugh, this damn heat...
261152642	This must be the end of the world...
366975255	We're gonna get them.
1855840901	Whew, damn this heat.
1491161968	Finally a pay raise.
1913170394	Never liked Frank much anyways.
142423906	What's Frank doing at the chapel?
1930113584	Feels like home.
575734296	How you doin'?
1519935307	Same as always, honey.
704699572	G'day.
345234162	Hey there.
1529310217	All fine?
963681716	Lookin' good.
1508522561	Anything unusual?
633737311	Nah, not really.
893184860	You smokin'?
266091656	Nah, sorry.
283958749	Let's go out for drinks later.
1832815518	Count me in.
417125625	Any trouble?
665752756	Nope. Nothin'.
379978104	You up for cards later?
15554859	Heh, always.
1253465029	How's life?
980886912	...Don't get me started.
1528494605	When do we ride?
110834351	Dunno. Soon.
1696110673	Hey, where's the whiskey!
141929277	You drank it all yesterday.
277673467	They sent an escort this time.
436673110	Heh, didn't help.
944957364	You see Big Ann?
1763918194	She's up on the plateau.
800888082	Townsfolk make any trouble?
1366707733	Ha, you kidding me!
2117806888	You holdin' up?
468040288	Another day in this shithole.
1178720293	How's it going?
1582073398	All's ready for the wedding.
1347637574	You see that bride's dress?
169945522	It's her big day.
202724784	You see anything?
1687480936	Not yet. Stay sharp.
1083592175	Any sight of the killers?
1056231024	They ain't getting through me.
1167284684	Big ranch, huh?
1405604961	I've seen bigger.
1707192343	Had to rain, huh?
631803191	You made of sugar or something?
490988109	You all right out here?
2090575245	Think I'm catching a cold.
1378797987	You hear about Flagstone?
589455558	Yeah. Fucking hicks.
254467420	You think he was alone?
205911424	Can't be sure. Stay sharp.
210292537	You see the guy?
610729880	Yeah. Fucking bounty hunter.
2009092597	Any idea what's going on?
1589568954	My money's on swamp witches.
822150051	You think it's true? The real devil?
1367509472	I don't wanna think about it.
1818479778	You think we can have the girl?
472744525	The boss'll cut you up!
618543810	What's taking so long?
310654731	We still got a few stragglers.
787794134	You got your orders?
243459725	Sure. It's all up here.
1577815376	Dragon's Den after shift?
1224663012	He he, count me in.
1228421755	You hear about the swamp witches?
1554847702	You believe in that crap?
675700753	What happened to Baxter's crew?
1653279823	Last catch was trouble.
495757108	Wonder what's on that ship?
1308020150	Things above our pay grade.
890541341	What's the matter with Frank?
32783462	He's brooding on something.
1140526318	What's with the new guys?
122221149	Frank said they could be trouble.
1616212481	You hear about New Orleans?
1843123998	I hear all kinds of stuff.
879105841	You think they'll come through here?
1236675024	DeVitt sure thinks so.
563860061	Frank wasn't kidding about these guys.
300889509	We'll get them.
1756467926	Nervous around rich folk, huh?
445057706	Shut up.
246663463	Can't believe we'll get double pay.
1681381248	Yeah. Frank's missing out.
4220470	You think they'll come?
1669771643	Frank says they will.
1146071298	Reminds me of the good old days.
2105234554	Yup. Still fucking hot.
455361327	Apparently it was the bride who shot him...
1731929939	Shit, and that their wedding day. We gotta find her.
46136178	Didn't think Miss O'Hara had it in her...
197474227	She's gotta be hiding somewhere. Keep your eyes peeled!
1597460529	You see anything suspicious?
1248105933	No, nothing. The bride's still loose, he he.
791584424	That bitch. She really shot the mayor?
359472671	Yeah. Keep looking! She still has to be here.
1888894895	Shouldn't be hard to spot her in that wedding dress.
47433293	We ain't got her yet. Let's keep watch.
1791962213	Shot him with that old shotgun from his office.
1795034072	Damn, she's got fire. Shame we gotta kill her.
70634817	Miss O'Hara is on the run! Keep your eyes open.
897644095	She really shot Higgins? Wow...
1274573802	Red hair, wedding dress covered in blood... 
646176078	Ain't no mistaking her. Shoot on sight.
252037491	We gotta find her. Higgins is dead, goddamnit.
1595378364	Yeah, she's gonna pay for that.
1843352868	I tell ya, he's a good-for-nothing.
267425427	Rough times, are they?
1476895954	Well, didn't think about that.
1451847378	Hm... You might be right.
785466897	That's what I thought all along.
167248632	Well, you know how they are...
478497347	Believe it or not, that's how it happened.
1006389889	Honestly, is that too much to ask?
234459454	But she's not better either.
1714459728	You sound like my old man.
1655993064	Not sure I'm following you here.
2138903618	Hm, you got a point there.
1547918202	You can never be sure.
1421996205	Rest assured, I got that from him personally.
152840365	It all went south after that...
223095935	I wonder if he is really that sort of guy.
13912038	Yeah, but that's just a rumor.
1587781406	Oh man, can't be helped I guess...
1666849018	Guess times are changing.
2018726600	That's news to me.
371141472	Hm, where did we leave off?
1365429293	Lost my thought... Ah, yes.
87853954	Where were we again...?
563214634	Okay, back to that other topic...
1808286305	Back to what you were saying...
664174008	One step further and you're dead.
995551208	You better back off. This area's locked.
836046602	Can't remember you... Can't let you in.
1022509533	Ey, you have business here?
482649674	You! You stay out of here.
1120933781	You better leave. I can't let you through.
1235568146	Turn back. This is private property.
44889663	I've never seen you. Get lost!
1102280353	Listen, we don't want the likes of you in there.
1730552887	This is company property. So get lost.
264366147	Private property. Out with you.
1507272777	This place ain't for you.
162495663	Ah... Can't find you on the guest list...
857210656	They mayor is busy. Come back later.
1540742953	You don't exactly look like a guest.
250665494	Company business. Stay back.
1750916794	Can't let you through. Company men only.
1883410907	Get lost, jerk. I see you're not one of us.
962549017	Hey, worker, you have no permission here.
1427349549	Get back to work... 
797396550	Nuh uh. We'll call you when it's your shift.
1147526598	This area is off limits for guests.
197046584	You got lost? Party's the other way.
1419974059	Got lost? The party's over there.
1943876794	Don't want to listen, huh?!
1507348859	Think you can ignore me?
764975081	I said no!
966552655	Tryin' to provoke me?
495037459	Stop there!
967536671	Hey! That's not all right!
736679735	Wait... What're you doin' there?
238695807	You're up to something!
1386713752	Tryin' to get attention, are ya?

1771342678	Alarm! Alarm!
536744783	Shit! There's no backup!
1557696297	Backup's gone. Damnit!
105752394	It's us against them, boys.
1589875039	What happened to the backup?
384706512	No backup! This is it!

1358399770	That's right, run away!
83652418	Nothing. Well, fuck.
1311516849	Keep your eyes open, everyone.
761341554	Stay sharp—they might be back.
1035382152	This isn't over yet.
621571729	Keep your eyes peeled, you hear me?
243309337	This ain't over. You better be ready.
381946195	Something's going on here. Stay sharp.
1554097924	Careful. We got troublemakers here.
1747802112	Eyes open. Someone's sneaking around.
1511239105	Look! Up there!
1981567975	How'd they get up there?!
756909435	Fuck me. They're above us!
545697767	Oh yeah? Why don't you come over here?!

1547398445	You're them troublemakers from Flagstone, aren't ya?
1174485889	You're on DeVitt Company property.
370847986	You sure didn't come with the train.

1388135222	You came to the wrong swamp!
1911997080	I'm gonna feed you to the gators.
2078068441	Welcome to the Queen's Nest, asshole.
748363178	Thought you'd slip through, huh?!
86370624	This is official DeVitt Company business!
1144812539	This district is off limits!
1791420512	I'm working with the law, asshole.
1877483082	You're going down the slave hole!
1632022592	Frank told us you'd make trouble.
980357420	No one ever escaped from here.
1986960774	You belong to DeVitt now.
141524377	We're gonna bury you alive!
610188268	You're gonna die in this dump!
706630341	If you're waiting for the train, forget it.
158886091	Train ain't gonna stop here. Give it up!
1742110610	Mr. DeVitt hates troublemakers!
1972539885	You're out of your league here!
1119849140	This is a private party!
928438655	Mr. DeVitt wants you gone.
1109087034	You'll never get to Frank!
704651513	Frank told us you'd come.
1533771035	I won't go down without a fight!
926427367	I killed my share of bounty hunters!
407465596	Is someone hiding in there?
1794532812	All right, I'm coming in!
127294075	You better not be in there!

253625569	Ah! You're in there, right?
939054034	I know you're in there!
2067461936	Did someone come through here?
840105191	Maybe they went through here?
2037477824	I'm going inside.
1434315698	Are you behind this door, sonny?
1152235915	I got the master key, asshole.
690329987	What's behind door number one?
559838910	Nothing. Oh fuck!
448052806	Must have imagined it?
912745952	Shit... Back to work.
1506358114	I should cut back on the whiskey.
413080719	Maybe just the wind.
980592575	Fuck this. I got better things to do.
1031121723	Nope. Nothing. Fucking waste of my time.
299275395	Forget it. Not my problem.
174410163	Don't matter. They're gone.
435688191	Gone. Well shit.
991987526	Just remembered I don't care.
276012313	Tch... Who am I kidding.
2133675146	Fine. Just don't come back!
243615344	I'm gonna get you next time!
1640808173	Okay then! Stay the fuck away!
1278364169	You got lucky this time!
1204687627	What the hell am I doing?
1873375750	Fucking jokers.
463651741	Shit. I was all in for a fight.
486680853	Goddamnit, every time!
2007590864	I'm gettin' too old for this shit.
718569547	Not my problem.
873431633	I have better things to do.
1111963296	I ain't moving.
165227857	I'll stay here, thank you very much.
1450242857	That's somebody else's problem.
1439013845	Ain't worth the trouble.
479736284	I'm gonna stay right here.
291917129	Fuck this, I'm not going for a walk.
1545389191	Too much walking.

430407433	Yeah, that's too much trouble.
2071126532	I ain't getting paid enough for that.
829366961	Hello?
93266556	Are you hiding from me?
1622676785	Come on, I'm not in the mood.
427173856	Maybe wandered off.
1933660529	Probably taking a shit.
709473901	Okay fine. Be that way.
144505229	There you are! Jesus!

9563297	Forget it, that's nothing.
1166773605	Yeah, we ain't gonna fall for that.
765349796	I need a drink.
1775553916	Could use a smoke.
1846887733	Shit, I'm tired... 
1619155273	All's quiet.
1566012998	Nothing wrong here.
343228685	I'm bored.

1663449824	When do we ride out?
1813755931	Big Ann is smart.
1955858765	I want my share.
1738115486	What a shithole.
615722926	Don't trust these folks...
1722510061	Tch... Rich folks.
1411007972	It's wedding day.

2026383469	Hah... It's cold out here...
49935527	Gotta keep my eyes out.
1344162803	Frank's pissed.
1394251539	That was a wild night.
237450765	Damn those strangers.
428896756	Third catch this month.
953913872	Heh, I like the girl.
1193534161	Just doing my job.
1576081344	I like this city.
669523968	Damn swampflies.
1914847083	All's quiet in the bayou.
1206596888	I'm fucking soaked.
1014269464	Something's going on.
1134355921	Don't like the new ones.
287324203	The heat's killing me.
511062067	No meio do nada.
2112087483	We're gonna get them.
581535554	Shit, it's hot.
992654694	Double the pay, he he.
427260593	Who needs Frank.
814016506	This is the life.
630949107	Like the good old days.
1679047501	How's it going?
1024792436	It's all right.

874472673	How'd it go?
978415989	...Don't ask.
787365829	When do we ride?
811434909	Dunno. Soon.
1074714901	Hey, where's the booze?
364426822	Ran out yesterday.
586779463	They sent an escort this time.
1885776851	Heh, didn't help.
1565385502	You see Big Ann?
1130350609	She's on the plateau.
16843546	Townsfolk make any trouble?
556107838	You gotta be kidding me!
1736303003	How you holdin' up?
1120145463	Another day in this shithole.
879679491	How's it going?
1730222479	All's ready for the wedding.
1122157819	You see that bride's dress?
1048465469	It's her big day.
1159525544	You see anything?
1065722413	Not yet. Stay sharp.
783281928	Any sight of the killers?
1385766874	They ain't getting through me.
1136064546	Big ranch, huh?
1611676252	I've seen bigger.
748100038	Had to rain, huh?
1043958707	You made of sugar or something?
81585499	You all right out here?
967142917	Think I'm catching a cold.
1562914065	You hear about Flagstone?
1815695154	Yeah. Fucking yokels.
1903617370	You think he was alone?
2100807803	Can't be sure. Stay sharp.
1987021364	You see the guy?
661503340	Yeah. Fucking bounty hunter.
238490698	Any idea what's going on?
1986327888	My money's on swamp witches.
927594118	You think it's true? The real devil?
2017553315	I don't wanna think about it.
2140462299	You think we can have the girl?
704805060	The boss is gonna cut off your dick.
2077283865	What's taking so long?
1962133591	We still got a few stragglers.
849486524	You got your orders?
1622261359	Sure. It's all up here.
123038211	Dragon's Den after shift?
488419234	He he, count me in.
695425155	You hear about the swamp witches?
1704863296	You believe in that crap?
313652785	What happened to Baxter's crew?
1571330997	Last catch was trouble.
852944580	Wonder what's on that ship?
1223071091	Things above our pay grade.
1029659980	What's the matter with Frank?
1965962487	He's brooding on something.
53168163	What's with the new guys?
108571901	Frank said they could be trouble.
109506602	You hear about New Orleans?
1073579370	I hear all kinds of stuff lately.
1701757314	You think they'll come through here?
730942422	DeVitt sure thinks so.
185385555	Frank wasn't kidding about these guys.
879383690	We'll get them.
2118805611	Nervous around rich folk, huh?
1169516782	Shut up.
1633779178	Can't believe we'll get double pay.
1822001912	Yeah. Frank's missing out.
338364539	You think they'll come?
424674975	Frank says they will.
669746868	Reminds me of the good old days.
1271846511	Yup. But, still fucking hot.
104286188	Apparently it was the bride who shot him...
1422439916	Shit, and it their wedding day. We gotta find her.
1446886158	Didn't think Miss O'Hara had it in her...
1668377706	She's gotta be hiding somewhere. Keep your eyes peeled!
1913027358	You see anything suspicious?
738280091	No, nothing. The bride's still loose, he he.
1426146751	That bitch. She really shot the mayor?
1549538676	Yeah. Keep looking! She still has to be here.
2012721627	Shouldn't be hard to spot her in that wedding dress.
1143624651	We ain't got her yet. Let's keep watch.
1843428385	Shot him with that old shotgun from his office.
1936547703	Damn, she's got fire. Shame we gotta kill her.
1352042588	Miss O'Hara is on the run! Keep your eyes open.
522310545	She really shot Higgins? Wow...
103201151	Red hair, wedding dress covered in blood... 
74670632	Ain't no mistaking her. Shoot on sight.
1297602041	We gotta find her. Higgins is dead, goddamnit.
2044734072	Yeah, she's gonna pay for that.
1578414201	I tell you, it ain't gonna end well.
2108133839	Yeah, I heard about that.
443571602	Leave it to the professionals.
187401267	That's what I'm talking about.
1191804181	Tell no one, got it?
279608651	What about the other one?
701868283	Don't matter in the long run.
1569484848	Just listen for a second.
54341981	Sure, but what happens now?
418056327	Don't worry. I've seen it before.
217325324	Not sure I'm following you here.
1069428395	Can't believe I missed that.
1380438983	That's the difference right there.
461534641	He he, told you so.
853763718	That can't be true, can it?
118322569	You better believe it, buddy.
667805784	Yeah, but that ain't nothing new.
1059979492	You hear all kinds of things lately.
968670037	Guess times are changing.
1436242778	That's news to me.
908553193	Now, where was I?
1791293762	Lost my thought... Ah, yes.

487398982	This is official DeVitt Company business!
569477498	This district is off limits!
37292293	Don't blame me if you get shot.
667097012	This mine will be your grave.
1982268023	Frank warned us 'bout you!
223609910	No one ever escaped from here.
1364487245	You belong to DeVitt now.
778926781	This is the end of the line!
570737033	We've been waiting for you!
917055253	If you're waiting for the train, forget it.
1523897483	Train ain't gonna stop here. Just give it up!
310207093	DeVitt's gonna be real angry at you.
609092040	Something tells me you ain't been invited.
2096387495	This is private property!
1050504588	Disturbing the guests, are we?
1079712805	Come out... Frank's eager to see ya...
453437434	Frank told us you'd come.
2051371682	You wanna fight, I'll give you a fight!
959187160	Come on out... Frank wants to see ya...
1395871452	Maybe in this scrub...
491707452	Hiding in the bushes, huh...?
1193151457	You better not be in there!
638689431	What's that? Did I hear somethin' rustle?
117727521	Did that bush just move?
579395879	I'm gonna drag you outta there.
182681654	I bet you're in there...
596943375	I know you're in there!
1305169355	Maybe inside?
2026962321	May I come in?
1752231534	Knock knock, you're in here?
272989872	Hiding somewhere warm and cozy, huh?
1783300937	This would make a fine hideout...for idiots!
760568437	You thought nobody would search in here?
674530618	Uhh... This is too frustrating...
1243598409	I got better things to do.
1186121163	Nothing... Well shit.
1800570230	Guess they're gone now.
1834311332	I'm not in the mood for games...
743350973	Fine, you win. This time...
128545905	I'll save this bullet for another time.
159422756	Forget it. Not my problem.
1674194042	Better get back to my post.
546650281	Damn... Lost track of them.
382283632	A waste of my fucking time...
2126420578	Afraid of me? Good. Stay away!
1565230251	Come back when you grow some balls!
2070599256	There's no one here. 
1257210700	Well, this is getting boring.
272795503	Now I think about it...what do I care?
990012517	I win this round. Chicken!
1913239438	Go to hell... I'm outta here.
285455562	Oh, I hate this job!
1889979359	I'm off. This is goddamn ridiculous.
1565405284	The coast is clear it seems.
54652130	Not my problem.
1281613945	I have better things to do.
21833297	I ain't moving.
1245706436	I'll stay here, thank you very much.
1021395385	That's somebody else's problem.
1984840762	Ain't worth the trouble.
65052623	I'm gonna stay right here.
977727650	That's a bit far.
436618313	Well, I'll just stay here.
510029038	Ain't in the mood for a walk.
854383710	I'm doing just fine outside.
321707817	I'm gonna stay outside.
639954443	Can't go in there right now.
1087193122	Ain't in the mood for sunshine!
912709596	Got too much to do in here. 
1977560316	I better stay in here.
1034830951	Now I think about it...what do I care?
887204324	Nah, that's too much trouble.
1799678180	I ain't getting paid enough for that.
1967377616	Helloooo? Where are ya?
1692344080	Whatever it is that I did, I am sorry, awright!
292881560	Very funny, hiding from me! Hahaha...
866132850	Hm... Went off to the john, I bet.
1838243228	Will be back in time I imagine.
616888592	Okay fine. Be that way, y'asshole.
1071422103	You've been here all along?!
1467373019	Hey. I was kinda worried, you know.
1450426701	There you are! Don't leave all of a sudden like that!
217540555	Oh hell!

1089524827	Damn! What else can go wrong here?!
1819266016	Holy cow!
765195055	That ain't good!
100666274	Too late...
1573772460	How could that've happened?
435554925	Somethin's fishy about this.
1942413999	Damn... Fuckin' weird.
1625589755	No fuckin' way...
1626370438	Can't do nothing.
62664252	Better leave before I get forced to clean up. 
138475120	Can't be helped. Gotta go back.
422127413	What a mess...
1663965711	They should pay us more for doing this...
1284936154	Well, not my problem.
54224172	I don't like this. Someone's out there.
1339107181	Shit. This better not happen to me.
1306684135	Damn O'Haras. Guess they set up traps.

778690778	Ah...my head. What happened here?
506517737	The hunt is on.

1336914596	Forget about it. We'll get 'em another time.
1628196068	Stop searching. They'll be long gone by now. 
1542347569	Tss... It's no use. Let's go back.
1647219311	Too late... They're not here anymore.
1627691353	Good job, guys... We drove 'em off.
758478800	Can't find 'em... Let's leave it for now.
564091734	Not wastin' more time on this. Let's get back!
1803395457	This is taking too long! We got work to do!
245787015	Seems like they're gone. We drove 'em off...
1074928023	They ain't coming back. Good job.
877787157	Nice try, sweetie. But you're not my type.
1568640825	Go and hunt somewhere else!
1062928331	You really that desperate?
1133261931	Come on, you can do better than that.
647886074	Gotta stay at my post, darlin', ya know...

417890949	Tch. Just ignore it.
1000055898	Forget it, that's nothing.

362793116	Here's mud in your eye!
552044498	Makes me nervous, Frank bein' all happy.
913687008	The heat is killin' me.
51124310	I wish I had Big Ann's guts.
2038948507	What to buy from my share...
1108098643	Ugh... Only farmers hangin' out here.
1774619704	The brothel seems interesting.
933354630	I wonder what the dress cost...
318605891	Cake looks delicious...
428528347	Can you imagine ruinin' such a day. Evil bastards.
1368690655	Goddamn, did someone catch 'em yet?
1056632610	Mud and rain... I miss the city.
753158192	Hm... Lot to do on a ranch like this.
1962434139	This weather'll gimme foot rot.
1001246624	Can't shoot with cold fingers...
178231558	Gotta keep my eyes out.
1525545780	Frank's pissed.
1326138544	Finally somethin' happened here.
38317265	Wonder if they're still around...
1543724345	Damn witch. Creepin' me out.
1986395525	Wonder if I see that cat again.
241970618	Ah... The big city...
80490694	Heheh... I'd be a good dancer as well...
381463626	Hope these gators stay where they are.
139405933	Uch—another goddamn swampfly!
770507013	The dogs are restless.
55760462	Damn this rain...
2002298699	Don't like the new ones.
1298338195	Ugh, damn the heat...
846085680	This must be the end of the world...
1076128255	We're gonna get them.
1993371664	Whew, damn this heat.
720443656	Finally a pay raise.
438739397	Never liked Frank much anyways.
964020331	What's Frank doing at the chapel?
587392813	Feels like home.
2035681847	How you doin'?
1044141981	Same as always, honey.
395639976	G'day.

1945214623	Nah, not really.
1850772892	You smokin'?
2035457045	Nah, I quit.
1994301584	Let's grab a whiskey later.
2000416627	Count me in.
1818653764	Any trouble?
1354442175	Nope. Nothin'.
1017059575	You up for poker later?
948616721	Heh, always.
191460630	How's life?
1982182301	...Don't get me started.
757857194	When do we ride?
84423775	Dunno. Soon.
1982405997	Hey, where's the booze?
724293522	Ran out yesterday.
897008110	Them idiots sent an escort this time.
894091878	Heh, didn't help any.
1826262396	You see Big Ann?
1136829938	She's out on the plateau.
178549419	Townsfolk make any trouble?
450555212	You gotta be kidding me!
1019404277	How you holdin' up?
785665126	What do you think in this shithole.
158136934	How's it going?
643318950	All ready for the wedding.
1306623871	You see that bride's dress?
566985537	Yeah, I want one like that.
256188490	You see anything?
265307573	Ghnn, not yet. 
1121108997	Any sight of the killers?
914843897	Nah, nothin'.
1056564609	Big ranch, huh?
1788278542	I've seen bigger.
900358378	Had to rain, huh?
1272745437	Yeah, I hate it.
1934115128	You all right out here?
1518190448	Think I'm cramping up.
707758255	You hear about Flagstone?
1188609121	Yeah. Fucking yokels.
1480112490	You think he was alone?
1919279203	Can't be sure. 
1813362933	You see the guy?
245320565	Yeah. Fucking bounty hunter.
2034542664	Any idea what's going on?
811705492	My money's on swamp witches.
150824504	You think the devil stuff is true?
1252164735	Cut out the bullshit!
1079169072	You think we can have the girl?
685251376	Can't see why not!
1713138268	What's taking so long?
1499603987	We still got a few stragglers.
1745593257	You got your orders?
742237214	Sure thing.
433235354	Dragon's Den after the shift?
504605925	Yeah. Count me in.
1505708822	You hear about the swamp witches?
1700564390	You believe in that crap?
968620483	What happened to Baxter's crew?
1435416940	Last catch was trouble.
140127319	Wonder what's on that ship?
1531634430	Don't know, don't care.
1133364636	What's the matter with Frank?
607631772	He's just an asshole.
1356180627	What's with the new guys?
1043070066	Frank said they may be trouble.
39554420	You hear about New Orleans?
2139639107	I hear all kinds of shit lately.
165938375	You think they'll come through here?
1378046344	DeVitt sure thinks so.
1074278289	Frank wasn't kidding about these guys.
1425637737	We'll get them.
1807860050	You nervous around rich folk, huh?
871659451	Shut the fuck up.
2085238708	Can't believe we'll get double pay.
99920623	Yeah. Frank's missing out.
1622496921	You think they'll come?
1979166316	Frank says they will.
1349097216	Reminds me of the good old days.
2123026027	Yup. Still fucking hot.
1525328941	Apparently it was the bride who shot him...
726380380	Shit, and that their wedding day. We gotta find her.
710604572	Didn't think Miss O'Hara had it in her...
1958700309	She's gotta be hiding somewhere. Keep your eyes peeled!
369721948	You see anything suspicious?
627027123	No, nothing. The bride's still loose.
1059477225	That bitch. She really shot the mayor?
2109231030	Yeah. Keep looking! She's gotta be around here somewhere still.
994144412	Shouldn't be hard to spot her in that there wedding dress.
2046030986	We ain't got her yet. Let's keep watch.
2117413530	Shot him with that old shotgun from his office.
1796149936	Damn, she's got fire. Shame we gotta kill her.
544240185	Miss O'Hara is on the run! Keep your eyes open.
1847075463	Damn, she really shot Higgins? Wow...
1437581961	Red hair, wedding dress covered in blood... 
399086106	Ain't no mistaking her. Shoot her on sight, y'hear.
1748695363	Goddamnit, we gotta find her. I can't believe Higgins is dead.
1820971893	Yeah, she's gonna pay for that.
1990982888	I tell ya, he's a good-for-nothing.
1791840141	Rough times, are they?
2096279352	Well, didn't think about that.
1673603298	Hm... You might be right.
1294819616	That's what I thought all along.
1086552440	Well, you know how they are...
255807706	Believe it or not, that's how it happened.
239231212	Come on, honestly, is that too much to ask?
13584080	But she's not better either.
2126096872	You sound like my old man.
2117486046	Not sure I'm following you here.
994205992	Hm, you got a point there.
155907172	You can never be sure.
1243594504	Rest assured, I got that from him personally.
1988723144	It all went south after that...

1035280297	Someone hiding in there?
409771881	All right, I'm coming in!
184602670	You better not be in there!
658059170	Think you're clever, huh?
650923472	Did that bush just move?

752800426	Ah! You're in there, right?
1338965513	I know you're in there!
1090925682	Did someone come through here?
639323066	Maybe they went through here?
1147491747	I'm headin' inside.
1955772270	Are you behind this door, sonny?
1380948988	I got the master key, asshole.
106427872	What's behind door number one?
1986424345	Nothing. Oh shit.
707203098	Was I seeing things?
949954118	Shit... Back to work.
2097423576	I should've cut back on the whiskey.
1841415820	Maybe just the wind.
440382401	Fuck this. I got better things to do.
591425666	Nope. Nothing. Fucking waste of time.
315187556	Forget it. Not my problem.

283407228	I have better things to do.
1414754277	I ain't moving.
1583754256	I'll stay here, why thank you.
2111900995	I'll leave that to the amateurs.
34643824	Ain't worth the trouble.
330973030	I'm gonna stay right here.
954932680	Fuck this, I'm not going.

748933478	Hello?
1304517933	You hiding from me?
2144523201	Come on, I'm not in the mood.
1914777486	Maybe they wandered off.
558262880	Probably taking a shit.
57710055	Okay fine. Be that way.
1840181082	There you are! Jesus!

915712833	Bah. Ignore it.
669716157	Forget it, that's nothing.
1890520033	Nah, we ain't gonna fall for that.
968302468	I need a drink...
1976634989	Could use a smoke...
684229942	Shit, I'm tired... 
329605563	All's quiet.
1234982713	Nothing wrong around here.
2054253046	I'm bored...

1958306044	I want my cut.
1785639628	What a trumphole...
372085972	Don't trust these folks...

933782378	Hah... It's fucking cold out here...
637427537	Gotta keep my eyes out.
221442863	Frank's pissed.
2080010610	That was a wild night.
1433188860	Damn strangers.

1114313913	I'm fucking soaked.
845408524	Something's going on.
1474078324	Don't like the new ones.
1311627488	O calor está me matando.
1034401984	No meio da porra de lugar nenhum.
1580138250	We're gonna get them.

1676281527	How'd it go?
1458298050	...Don't ask.
700775099	When do we ride?
1114606101	Dunno. Soon I guess.
1539512333	Hey, where's the whiskey?
563471406	Ran out yesterday.
1881168711	They sent an escort this time.
331501360	Heh, didn't help, did it.
356900437	You see Big Ann?
1761211768	She's on the plateau.

736102210	Not yet. Stay sharp.
897276918	Any sight of the killers?
1319797596	They ain't getting through me.
1813152440	Big ranch, huh?
526989031	I've seen bigger.
798994880	Had to rain, huh?
751290997	You made of sugar or something?
778971126	You all right out here?
1308830227	I feel like shit.
2059198796	You hear about Flagstone?
617562221	Yeah. Fucking dipshits.
613565558	You think he was alone?
1556396043	Can't be sure. Stay sharp.
843921976	You see the guy?
1870759258	Yeah. Fucking bounty hunter.
2040304135	Any idea what's going on?
1072972777	My money's on swamp witches.
318658455	You think it's true? The devil?
398370780	Bullshit.
2101751536	You think we can have the girl?
653617457	Sure, but I'll cut off your dick.
639734140	What's taking so long?
1556017382	We got stragglers.
1609638288	You got orders?
727568906	Sure. It's all up here.
104283532	Dragon's Den after the shift?
291182726	He he, count me in.
1616305068	You hear about the swamp witches?
1747991805	You believe in that crap?
270859230	What happened to Baxter's crew?
820013684	Dunno, don't care.
571114936	Wonder what's on that ship?
1441419986	Things above your pay grade.
1042432921	What's the matter with Frank?
1910622701	He's brooding on something.
1939765259	What's with the new guys?
1837604258	They look like trouble.
1159826515	You hear about New Orleans?
115889478	I hear all kinds of stuff.
1394351873	You think they'll come through here?
726062406	DeVitt thinks so.
647364467	Frank wasn't kidding about these guys.
1897321809	We'll get them.
1550068151	Nervous around rich folk, huh?
1294237773	Shut up.
164566410	Can't believe we'll get double pay.
919588120	Yeah. Frank's missing out.
377812646	You think they'll come?
1829192794	Frank says they will.
1506684798	Reminds me of the good old days.
1482141939	Yup. Still fucking hot.
815439882	Apparently it was the bride who shot him...
1220306816	Shit, and on their wedding day. We gotta find her.
795150813	Didn't think Miss O'Hara had it in her...
2101247489	She's gotta be hiding somewhere. Keep your eyes peeled!
1773488079	You see anything suspicious?
1393023654	No, nothing. The bride's still loose, he he.
216553564	That bitch. She really shot the mayor?
1914650132	Yeah. Keep looking! She still has to be here.
1626053940	Shouldn't be hard to spot her in that wedding dress.
663413808	Well we ain't got her yet. Let's keep watch.
1713519856	Shot him with that old shotgun from his office.
1347688612	Damn, she's got fire. Shame we gotta kill her.
1549494257	Miss O'Hara is on the run! Keep your eyes open.
1660614251	She really shot Higgins? Shiiiit...
1384370286	Red hair, wedding dress covered in blood... 
1564416195	Ain't no mistaking her. Shoot on sight.
1556866621	We gotta find her. Higgins is dead, goddamnit.
791506338	Yeah, she's gonna pay for that.
1588598519	I tell you, it ain't gonna end well.
1632029670	Yeah, I heard about that.
303471306	Leave it to the professionals.
1882027727	That's what I'm talking about.
33733430	Don't tell anyone, okay?
1665614839	What about the other one?
1291877905	Doesn't matter in the long run.
1347541565	Just listen for a second.
792449172	Sure, but what happens now?
321630651	Don't worry, I've seen it before.
335558195	Not sure I'm following you.
681743251	Can't believe I missed that.
1015447519	That's the difference right there.
1442527014	He he, told you so.
1249184003	That can't be true, right?
951741986	You better believe it, buddy.
1871159013	Yeah, but that ain't nothing new.
1425141805	You hear all kinds of things lately.
795143967	Guess times are changing.
1015248530	That's news to me.
1430531581	Now, where was I?
170538406	Lost my thought... Ah, yes.
1445017864	As I was saying...
1495818321	Right, where were we...
1660328201	Back to the point...
901581960	You ain't gettin' through here.
302095887	Ain't nothing here for you! Piss off.
476402428	You got no business here. Move along!
954851404	You best not try getting past me.
1458995942	No one's getting inside.
1206689677	Stay back. There's nothing to see here.
589771817	We got a problem here? Stay back.
387444895	What are you looking at? Leave!
1691889353	Fuck off, understand?
978811524	Aww, you wanna go in there? Too bad.
1485337258	The company owns this place now. Back off.
1912490676	Back off. Fucking shitheads.
1356432825	You ain't on the guest list, pal.
1223311281	They mayor is busy. Come back later.
928160567	You don't look like you have an appointment.
1327942117	Company business. Fuck off.
418477261	You got no business in here. Leave.
541324382	Company men only.
1919899929	You ain't getting out of here, scum.
1054424512	Get back to your tent, asshole.
120225157	Nuh uh. We'll call you when it's your shift.
2140957104	This area is off limit for guests.
2136299579	Stay with the other guests, will ya.
1218886085	This ain't the way to the party, got it?
2010412953	Are you stupid!
1834962360	You should have listened!
59912138	Bad move!
1337396434	Oh no you don't!
1227177747	Hey, I told you!
826064957	Wait, that's not right!
539088846	Hey, what are you doing?
1969330897	Are you being serious?
1111792879	Cut it out, motherfucker!
543913408	Oh, you think you're funny!

1806109170	What am I paying you all for? Get them!
316290864	Damn you all! Guards!
831227044	Hello?! Guards!
791395241	Men! Take care of this!
1403579470	Guards! Get rid of them!
1518169020	This party isn't for you!
1203772156	I don't tolerate intruders!
2071753645	We have some unwanted guests here!
829874037	Not at my party!
1361837692	You won't get me so easily!
1114504376	Remove yourself from my property.
83552788	Haven't you learned your lesson?!
1385884705	I thought you smarter than this!
2063215583	Where the fuck are my men?
1481387523	Did you kill my guards?
852313395	Do I have to do everything myself?!
2124095848	Am I surrounded by incompetence?
294645845	I don't need help to put you down.
1534316484	Back to your posts. Keep watch.
1140985821	They're gone for now. Get back to work.
776177291	They ran off. Keep them from the guests, understand?
1419293313	Are you having fun up there?
2031447793	Up there! Shoot them!
814595007	Why don't you come over here?!
1147097553	That won't keep you safe!

1720915391	They killed him!
384829084	A dead body!
188612431	Murder!
1643134449	Murdered by another guard. Hmm.
1209633360	One of the guards killed him. Interesting.
408667828	Got murdered by another guard.
812740126	One of the guards killed her. Curious.
1023904583	Killed by one of their own. Could it be?
1988609732	Hmm. One of the guards is responsible for this.
1592973206	What is your goal here?
884792297	Is that your crude attempt at a joke?
70372748	I'm not scared so easily.
590406555	Never seen those prints before.
1789033228	Who could have left those tracks?
202187711	Who is sneaking around here?
1085187391	Tracks. Better keep an eye on them.
1944060873	Who let the light go out?
237268403	Idiots! The light!
1893385394	Do I have to do everything myself?
2009838222	Again with the light!
2108635854	Oh, you're gonna pay!
228953129	Hand's off my staff!
204676552	That was a mistake!
280847419	Traps! Watch out!
191852096	They laid traps!
1388210659	Watch your step, you fools!
899368850	Sniper!
228984779	Shapshooter!
740977138	They're shooting sharp!
248854386	The witch is here!
1925932487	It's the witch!
1748947354	I know you're here Isabelle!
1796053590	Idiot! You're under her spell!
84751004	You! She took hold of you!
333217423	Stop that! Resist her!
251303684	Intruder!
143097900	How dare you!
444540159	I see you now!
1642132927	Lowlife trash!
546468416	You'll regret this!
1433352079	You should have run!
270675320	Did the marshal send you?!
9628966	You can't hide from me!
128851288	Mr. Cowboy!
1234596221	It's Mr. Cowboy!
31805583	God, you stink!
1574651767	It's the hairy ape!
1265764464	It's Miss O'Hara!
1740516422	Miss O'Hara, what a surprise!
420559250	It's Doctor McCoy!
1534933692	Come for your money, Dr. McCoy?!
197923969	Isabelle! What a surprise!
910483118	Crawling back to me, Isabelle? Too bad!
591259153	Your body odor gives you away.
1641076744	Enjoy yourself back there?
2055411016	How much longer are you going to stand there?
1385413768	Now which of my guests lost that?
393804537	Who left that lying around?
1062284104	That wasn't there before!
1560459278	Not gonna leave that here.
1751477529	Now where have I seen that before... 
1784764926	I think that belongs to me.
1493337522	Waste not I suppose.
1909186069	Is she asleep?!
647722521	What's she doing there?!
1737246285	Is he asleep?!
1901815276	What's he doing there?
1412855313	Sleeping on the job, are we?
2007161108	What's the matter with you?
916079691	Well he didn't get far.
1614834537	He's the one it seems.
473106361	Well she didn't get far.
1961202396	She's the one it seems.
646822338	You're the traitor.
1761444179	It was you, wasn't it?
1878855251	There's the traitor. My my.
237481060	Here we have the traitor.
17636101	We'll deal with him later.
1944904529	Let's leave him here for now.
759126685	We'll deal with her later.
667089479	Let's leave her here for now.
238226326	We'll have to deal with you later.
879555403	Stay put for now. We'll deal with you later.
1978942643	They tied her up!
851224279	Seems like they got to her!
1517570203	They tied him up!
1529313265	I see they got to him!
742149905	So, they got the better of you!
1071533503	Who tied you up?
2041423786	You! Go investigate.
2079499196	Someone head on over there now!
1761497001	Take a look at this. Move it!
741284909	Where is she?
1771794158	What's keeping her?
1322699159	She leaves me waiting.
67006466	Where is he?
1343048559	What's keeping him.
667276149	So, he leaves me waiting.
1414126201	Seems I'm to be kept waiting.
1264643628	Where are you. Time's wasting.
506095499	What's keeping you?
1661124733	Hey! Wake up!
1332820510	Wake up, will you?
1058536612	Stand up, for God's sake.
1288927396	Who did this to you? Speak up!
1980221633	Useless idiot. Who did this?!
352132655	Stop making noise, will you?
137010481	Are you trying to get fired.
446202037	I'll find out who's doing this.
985395987	Did I hear a fake coin?
624898316	I know fake money when I hear it.
1718983697	Who's making such a racket?
571653234	You're playing a dangerous game.
532050061	I'm going to find you.
1945401608	All right, that is enough!
1288014195	Gunfire!
2028646545	That's not the fireworks.
480288405	We're under fire.
1267674436	Oh, I heard that!
1332528485	Who's there?
571444925	Anyone there?
1016309161	That's enough!
1079836656	I'll find out who's doing this.
169302793	I'll make you regret this.
1052152850	N-no. Must have imagined.
800413995	That noise... is she here?
2040550454	That sound... Is it her?
462174017	What am I doing?
300528760	No, it's nothing.
652241538	This is ridiculous.
981969789	I don't have time for this.
1088424175	This is ridiculous.
1381684006	This is a waste of time.
493409296	I don't tolerate interruption.
1439739996	This is not on the schedule.
408736180	I promise, I will find you.
213145163	... I'm gonna have your head.
1246203934	... Biggest mistake you ever made.
262109220	... Wait until I find you.
1989332955	Is anyone here?
1391336186	Let's make this quick.
594787470	You are wasting my time.
1238409292	You're only making it worse.
1875300633	Hiding won't help you.
1770166612	Must we do this now?
942732437	You're only prolonging the inevitable.
804945341	Don't make me come in there.
1398446800	You think I won't get myself dirty?
1010131037	Hiding in the garden decor?
278355956	Will I find you behind this door?
1857091222	This door looks suspicious.
178151487	Let's open this door.
1113602196	Nothing. Waste of time.
442101039	I'll deal with you later.
1753674666	Very well. Back to the guests.
332598351	I don't have time right now.
1744126171	I have more important things to do.
684089007	Let somebody else handle that.
208883656	This matter takes priority.
132089631	Can someone please handle that.
423948232	That is much too far.
99076553	I'm not in the mood for a walk.
1439200992	Like I have time to go there.
1979340988	No, I am needed outside.
362875299	No, I must handle things outside.
1821515628	I don't have time to go inside now.
46113766	There's no way over there.
721485570	That would be far too much trouble.
2041546504	Over there? Ridiculous.
1812586699	We don't have time for this?
511696960	Are you avoiding me?
684849312	How dare you let me wait!
1019198555	There goes a fruitless conversation.
1109664261	Never liked them one anyway.
491055750	Scratch them off the guest list.
1791306829	Ah, there you are!
583438478	Must you wander off like that?
1326363176	An accident?
430831352	Don't tell me...
1974504592	You idiots!
1651834968	How did this happen?
1265083368	Who was on post here?
689179909	Am I surrounded by idiots?
1202939630	Leave it for now. Don't worry the guests.
360978347	Clean this up after the guests are gone.
1613092866	Don't let the guests don't see this.

1939098287	A little stumble...
954435956	Hmm...
1481041920	Well...
591052720	Is that...?
860272488	Something...
1643420733	What in God's name...?
408851692	Curious...
56750221	Well now...
409570170	Interesting...
1484806052	Do I see...?
1666395169	Oh?
1230630539	Who let you in here?
326354771	A cat? Oh my...
271996246	Did somebody bring a cat?
879653332	No, no, I don't have food.
957834283	Just like hers.
1747027955	I'll keep my eye on you.
1444263959	Run along now.
1453725348	Gotta send someone to catch that thing.
244868824	... bastards!
653229373	... imbeciles!
1219628151	... grave mistake!
748819300	... that smell...
485379176	... pardon me.
1845262298	... excuse me.
469757349	N-no! ... I'm listening...
244567012	It's her! I must... listen...
1019535214	Her voice in my head...
1507298399	You! N-no! ... yes?
2107655984	What can I do for you...?
1611355156	You have my attention...
774957985	Anything you need...?
305394347	Get out... you... yes?
1735217189	Damn... I... I'm listening.
1829159243	A pleasant converastion.
532745668	My speciality.
37391788	I can talk for hours.
645178327	They will listen to me.
718242854	My word, their command.
1586465556	I have more than enough.
837367567	I can spare this much.
1352956859	They will come running.
1902154468	More than they'll ever have.
1689064435	I earned every cent.
1526017687	Certainly.
1529721759	Leave it to me.
1191980866	It's already done.
68662569	I will take care of it.
1286994677	Yes indeed.
776691725	As you will.
51331123	Most definitely.
1279262191	I'm on it.
1688140964	Very well.
404385307	I'll give it my attention.
654081491	No.
1348980014	I'm afraid not.
568086333	Impossible.
251187941	I cannot.
1894354135	That is beyond my ability.
177808790	This will do.
2026475580	As instructed.
1789169659	It is done.
953403562	Taken care of.
2005525130	You there.
1704883187	A word.
877967253	I must speak to you.
537134640	Listen.
819771057	My good fellow.
344959370	Best take note of that.
2063229573	We understand each other?
1932245716	I think you see my point.
386775648	Let me elaborate.
1236227568	Carry on, by all means.
1798475574	Don't let me keep you.
2088173535	Run along now, chop chop.
1268074017	A modest investment.
929943354	This should suffice.
314553147	Let's put out the offer.
696842309	A return investment.
1829004096	Waste not.
1219083426	I'll have that, thank you.
755561192	...
79653357	...
2033884235	...
748544497	...
563713071	W-what? What happened?
1855524731	Ugh... something in the wine?
1753738118	Hrm... this is most peculiar.
334362602	Huh... I don't remember getting here.
811499609	Yes, yes...
139982318	No... that's not right...
129892242	Put it on the list...
2146735133	This needs taking care of...
550513612	Must stay on schedule.
973700004	What would father say...
217262855	Who needs Frank...
1658069105	Good riddance...
551034644	Cheers!
1192660334	To good health!
1543856651	Here's looking at you.
839011162	I've spared no expense.
750320948	Now, where was I.
203456593	Right, where were we.
1890741263	As I was saying.
752141871	Wait... do I know you?
1904631849	What's this... you seem familiar...
1260272422	Is that... who are you...
592966686	Stop that, or I'll have you removed.
755615184	It appears we have a clown here.
1572402751	Don't be ridiculous, mind you.
714144920	Oh hell no!
1762180751	Please no!
194421162	Oh God!

2090329709	I can't stay here!
1627608269	Quick!
483753970	Don't move an inch.
889379980	Why does this keep happening?
1490848557	This ain't good.
669098849	Gotta take cover.

1294212533	It's a dead body!
2125915304	Oh, that one's dead!
629305294	He got killed by one of his own.
1027670450	One of the guards killed him.
212655113	She got murdered by one of the guards.
546507246	One of the guards killed her.
1234665031	One of the guards did this. Damn.
2070475568	Dead. One of the guards did this.
549506185	Oh, what the hell?
1383649524	You're joking, right?
1197557480	Jesus!
129476208	Who made those?

1283245285	H-hey, that's not normal!
1697704330	N-no, stop that!
924245651	Could be worth something!
289903634	Now where did that come from?
1866172367	That wasn't there before!
1491918501	I can't leave it there.
1336887699	Come to Papa.

804356235	Okay fine. Be that way.
849635496	There you are! Jesus!

929047574	How are you holding up?
1850282191	I'm fine.
733864984	Anything wrong?
1420908823	It's nothing.
1884884578	You got a smoke?
191589003	Sorry, no. 
888651243	You up for a drink later?
1396553097	Sure thing.

1220737273	Heh, always.
678278154	How'd it go?
1285460911	...Don't ask.
1007896959	When do we ride?
1760552701	Dunno. Soon.
1203286750	Hey, where's the booze?
570369904	Ran out yesterday.
145962558	Who's gonna help?
1714073299	We gotta wait and see.
184420272	I hate bandits.
1683267159	That makes two of us.
169501826	Workers make any trouble?
1126307118	Not more than usual.
365278353	You okay?
927108486	I'll manage.
1054705238	How's it going?
856505925	Almost ready for the wedding.
1337005302	You see the bride's dress?
1795144458	Yeah. Looks expensive.
733749545	You see anything?
331920333	No, and I don't want to.
253343907	Mayor Higgins, dead.
1490816363	It's a tragedy.
665822463	Big ranch, huh?
1516948694	I've seen bigger.
1884707244	Had to rain, huh?
942095769	You made of sugar or something?
584583294	It's freezing!
140600418	Think I'm catching a cold.
2080882179	You hear about Flagstone?
2123720088	Yeah. Townsfolk got edgy.
574742714	You think he was alone?
933846796	Can't be sure. Stay sharp.
1835147000	You see the guy?
1036207264	Yeah. Damn bounty hunter.
783829071	Any idea what's going on?
371923642	My money's on swamp witches.
2114089369	You think it's true? The real devil?
839500131	I don't wanna think about it.
1949628177	You think we can have the girl?
437886225	If you want your dick cut off.
1563311191	What's taking so long?
1805646588	We still got a few stragglers.
105877657	Lovely night, huh?
1437101900	Yup.
675000180	You hear who's coming?
872081782	Yeah. It'll be some show.
344837768	We gotta break out of here.
655844167	Not yet.
1625808834	How do we get out?
1439004688	Gotta be patient.
816404149	What's that ship that came in?
661170697	Belongs to the DeVitt Company.
1435172741	Why'd they block the roads?
669447907	Company business, I guess.
610164075	I can hardly stand.
1247703699	You and me both.
230914525	I can't take this.
1816884307	Stay strong, friend.
1973449938	What are they doing here?
1061398885	Breakout at the mine.
1158072521	They're on edge.
1509037970	Dangerous men they're huntin'.
832941152	Everything on schedule?
481755568	More or less.
1257868930	You saw what happened with Frank?
1783101948	Don't let Mr. DeVitt hear you.
1185693792	You think they'll come?
876597107	Frank says they will.
1890853346	Reminds me of the good old days.
2138187520	Yup. Still fucking hot.
1840074735	I tell ya, it ain't gonna end well.
717855587	Yeah, I heard about that.
609448203	I say leave it to the professionals.
1323368223	That's what I'm talking about.
894982659	Oh please don't tell anyone, okay?
1833407896	What about the other one?
1979116485	Doesn't matter in the long run.
1091594973	Just listen for a second.
989425648	Sure, but what happens now?
801397173	Don't worry. I've seen it before.
1236715719	Not sure I'm following you here.
1826402428	Can't believe I missed that.
1371386793	That's the difference right there.
630021603	He he, told you so.
955780581	That can't be true, right?
188273265	You better believe it.
1720195152	Yeah, but that ain't nothing new.
1489094158	You hear all kinds of things.
1864759570	Guess times are changing.
1257814581	That's news to me.
971009953	Now, where was I?
171486738	Lost my thought... Ah, yes.
416648708	As I was saying...
1085013886	Right, where were we...
1968202159	Back to the point...
671880834	W-wait wait wait, that's not right!
1579815946	Hey, what are you doing?
1309790604	Would you please stop that!
603723275	Stop it! Cut it out!
322269652	You're a queer fella.
40314205	Are you being weird on purpose?
1141136403	What are you doing here?
129939999	You really shouldn't be here!
1610055770	You better not let them see you!

933439464	Quick!
218582852	Don't move an inch.
890401936	Why does this keep happening?
1137691250	This ain't good.
1281619810	Gotta take cover.

1199855867	One of the guards killed him.
778840773	She got murdered by one of the guards.
117877211	One of the guards killed her.

1525352676	Who's been walking here?
829255321	Who left those tracks.
1725558943	Damn. Light went out.
1287498134	Who let the light go out?
203602001	Good thing I got matches.

840476864	Heh, bottoms up!
584709926	Down the hatch!
775874072	Here's mud in your eye!
1936459737	Frank's in a good mood.
1012301273	When do we ride out?
1139859870	Damn bandits...
1997102153	You ain't getting me!
465437588	Hope it stays quiet...
905926198	It's getting late...
585802436	Tch... Rich folks.
1186357806	It's wedding day.
1821853543	The mayor's dead...
1662303859	Killer's still loose.
337962660	Damn rain.
2077189993	...! Big ranch.
1399324926	Shift's almost over...
1976109245	Hah... It's cold out here...
658994837	We're stuck here.
999022320	Gah... Cold hands.
309210941	Gotta keep my eyes out.
2110497741	Frank's angry.
38631796	That was a wild night.
1005387535	Damn those strangers.
456942412	Third catch this month.
257248617	Heh, I like the girl.
513018954	Ah, New Orleans.
1726806938	Gotta love the city at night.
874532731	I gotta get out of here.
1649831488	You can't do this to me.
2015404106	Soaking wet.
1704600156	Something's going on.
1696809433	So tired.
114095251	Can't take much more...
149333271	What do they all want here?
13935342	Damn strangers.
764603441	Damn, it's hot.
1828095554	Look at all the fancy folk.
504871116	Everything on schedule.
404924154	This is the life.
870224807	Like the good old days.
814754320	How's it going?
647686182	It's all right.
1237125489	Hey.
1583263944	Howdy.
695468909	How are you holding up?
143632231	I'm fine.
2043360240	Anything wrong?
1569125277	It's nothing.
1334804824	You got a smoke?
1760183324	Sorry. 
414070090	You up for a drink later?
421142466	Sure am.
1865588823	Any trouble?
793717695	Nah, nothin'.
836637711	You up for poker later?
571639356	Why not.
715152438	How'd it go?
203221805	...Don't ask.
1998810944	When do we ride?
1658273459	Dunno. Soon.
1859171146	Hey, where's the whiskey?
1093194854	Ran out yesterday.
1974983804	Who's gonna help?
1972223928	Gotta wait 'n' see.
456170218	I hate bandits.
968900901	That makes two of us.
900044987	Workers make any trouble?
1401345004	Not more than usual.
1564864007	You okay?
1663811552	I'll manage.
522896107	How's it going?
1577875827	Almost ready for the wedding.
384578159	You see that bride's dress?
1787157100	Yeah. Looks expensive.
697186087	You see anything?
2120873238	No, and I don't want to.
781830452	Mayor Higgins, dead.
834529438	It's a tragedy.
1718376515	Big ranch, huh?
998231926	Never seen bigger.
874940981	Had to rain, huh?
945075548	I hate rain.
1873570525	It's freezing.
742572414	Think I'm catching a cold.
710386254	You hear about Flagstone?
205219891	Yeah. Townsfolk are edgy.
1666170682	You think he was alone?
268694333	Can't be sure. Be careful.
1548456137	You see the guy?
1385877758	Yeah. Damn bounty hunter.
1648383777	Any idea what's going on?
688417624	My money's on swamp witches.
1934889879	You think it's true? The real devil?
354422264	I don't wanna think about it.
1938581895	You think we can have the girl?
1048254329	If you try, the boss'll cut you up.
951866929	What's taking so long?
1717911467	We still got a few stragglers.
2008161612	Lovely night, huh?
396823285	Yup.
1819882843	You hear who's coming?
1568864476	Yeah. It'll be a show.
329787197	We gotta break out of here.
549501391	Not yet.
1869817065	How do we get out?
1972569024	Gotta be patient.
1436464429	What's that ship that came in?
1399788681	Belongs to the DeVitt Company.
355923929	Why'd they block the roads.
1219777739	Company business, I guess.
60157860	I can hardly stand.
1393407182	You and me both.
2076908451	I can't take this.
43880783	Come on, stay strong.
1391163337	What are they doing here?
137736140	Breakout at the mine.
1889947113	They're on edge.
1558147933	Dangerous men they're huntin'.
1175262044	Everything on schedule?
507705795	More or less.
1074087586	You saw what happened with Frank?
300100531	Don't let Mr. DeVitt hear you.
1054134165	You think they'll come?
1491586680	Frank says they will.
1798229286	Reminds me of the good old days.
230845775	Yup. Still fucking hot.
1552657520	I tell you, it's gonna end bad.
1057442044	Yeah, I heard about that.
790946530	Just leave it to the professionals.
1499609338	That's what I'm talking about.
344865819	Don't tell anyone, okay?
659828860	What about the other one?
1869964673	Doesn't matter in the long run.
472808940	Just listen for a second.
285958914	Sure, but what happens now?
2089103290	Don't worry. I've seen it before.
1978903148	Not sure I'm following you here.
1730064588	Can't believe I missed that.
623917837	That's the difference right there.
149023944	He he, told you so.
2134446096	That can't be true, right?
164172599	You better believe it.
605835899	Yeah, but that ain't nothing new.
334581915	You hear all kinds of things lately.
2128479296	Guess times are changing.
1451790603	Now, where was I?
804274874	Lost my thought... Ah, yes.
541968187	As I was saying...
1880376000	Right, where were we...
2066633555	Back to the point...
1186386859	Wait, that's not right!
588860568	Hey, what are you doing?
1358040690	Please, stop that!
978125345	Cut it out!
2061818366	You're a weird fella.
94758300	Are you being weird on purpose?
746061915	What are you doing here?
2083785457	You really shouldn't be here!
101008449	You better not let them see you!
1907212783	...
519537571	...
341264829	...
1363763145	...
713536592	...
171145234	...
1014790765	Help!
989977957	Sweet Jesus!
1269945565	Oh God!
677144367	Aaaaah!
1562152587	Help! Help!
122466952	Somebody help!
1161755543	Anyone! Help!
1129762839	I have to get away!
1661146369	I can't stay here!
477408661	Quick!
1329407595	Don't move a muscle.
1758165406	Why does this keep happening?
1460125519	This is rather unfortunate.
2103353189	I must take shelter.
187080243	...!

1222996569	...
1481444871	...
926749492	She's expired!
1032701597	Sweet lord! She's dead!
644230811	He's expired.
1339022726	Sweet Jesus! He's dead!
679261598	A corpse! Good lord!
787111205	Murdered in cold blood!
137622328	He was slain by one of the guards.
128367548	A fellow guard took his life.
1878324855	She was murdered by one of the guards.
322881014	A fellow guard took her life.
2079658181	Slain by a fellow guard. Most barbaric.
943369970	Dead. One of his comrade's handiwork.
2135308566	Sweet Jesus!
248698339	Is this a practical joke?
1831569684	Good lord!
545198748	Who's been through here?
857644174	I don't recall seeing these footprints.
1106319344	Who left this ominous trail behind?
1459099030	Footprints. Why am I talking to myself about footprints?
1880829761	Damnation. The light's gone out.
87931754	Again with the light? Imbeciles.
1608821175	That's why a gentleman always carries matches.
1774461724	Come now. Again with the light?
999288897	W-what in God's name?!
155352666	Ah! What struck him down?
811364465	Good lord! Witchcraft!
1909954323	You're possessed by demons!
1946839457	Stop! How could you?!
514973833	Stop stop stop! No! I forbid it!
1137108537	That certainly looks valuable.
6158985	Who'd leave such a thing here?
1584664409	I don't recall seeing this before.
1713307810	A shame to leave that there.
233173682	You have a new owner, my dear.
396470098	I'm gonna stake my claim.
568656315	I think a few drinks at the club are in order.
1663095007	How fortunate.
970560449	Fortune favors me today.
1460883400	Is she asleep?
122785398	What is she doing?
457095152	Is he asleep?
1436574620	What is he doing?
8500268	Hey! What's with you?
409849873	Lazing about, are we?
402594879	They tied her up!
486328269	They violated her!
1953815265	They tied him up!
986719040	They overwhelmed him!
2125364244	They tied you up good!
1504364934	Who put you in this sorry state?
491194207	Where is she?
1513173482	Where has she gone?
2117085605	I'm sure she was here just now.
1773818681	Where's he gone to?
1830459840	Where did he go?
173132338	I know he was just here...
765323237	Seems I'm missing a partner.
641896524	I'm being kept waiting, apparently.
2010722541	Hey! What's keeping them?
1085219086	Come now, friend. Wake up.
1490703397	Hey! Wake up, will you?
755917233	Are you all right?
1719937859	What fiend did this to you?
50158868	Let me take care of you.
741682702	Hmm, what?
356275362	What a peculiar noise.
1743464943	What was that?
465000023	Come out, whoever's doing this!
242097202	Yes, yes, very entertaining!
1451448039	That is quite enough!
2145582387	Where did that come from?!
1453655046	Gunfire! Good lord!
95334163	Are they hostile?
1590317857	I could have sworn...
305141883	I heard you! Come out!
2107783367	Is anyone there?
729587925	Enough already!
903584911	I bid you to stop that.
1008129282	Stop this nonsense.
1545574847	What the heavens was that?
1254126773	Am I going quite mad?
1415842393	Ah! Uh...what?
731676266	What am I doing?
1189760960	Never mind.
794351717	This is stupid.
374260894	What is going on here?
1329839495	Is anyone here?
796553630	Anyone? Show yourself!
1866029801	This jest has had its course.
2053674476	I am not in the mood for games.
1831166710	Nothing. Oh well.
845398419	Nothing to be done here.
1780584176	Gone. Back to it then.
674709935	I have better things to do.
1437730057	This was a waste of time.
1299942279	I'm not going to walk there.
1640465420	I'm disinclined to walk there.
993004793	This is too far off.
1909611695	I am not heading inside.
419538965	I'd rather stay outside.
1978126007	I cannot go in there right now.
1589210863	I am not heading outside.
1759463777	I'd rather stay inside.
743744918	I cannot go outside right now.
660432505	There's no way over there.
961922039	That's far too much trouble.
551665224	Over there? Hah, you jest.
1744452721	They wandered off, most likely.
2083614504	Maybe they had to relieve themselves.
982159749	Stood up again.
12769101	There you are! I was worried sick!
1954035693	Why would you wander off like that?
60906486	Good lord! You put the scare in me!
1423657536	Oh my! 
327776189	Damnation.
1925088417	This is horrible.
984475121	This can't be happening.
313642094	Lord almighty.
275979261	Horrible. Just horrible.
1813860401	Tragic. Most tragic.
712452653	I will have nightmares from this.
1161255884	Nothing to be done about it.

554121962	Uhm...
1817559867	One moment...
1733565541	What's that?
1461059046	Something...
2086844794	What on earth...
1617325257	Strange...
1409678172	Curious...
1863693078	Hey now...
780393761	Is that...?
449465132	What...?
135496765	Hmm...
212940520	Uhhh...
1353435356	Hey there, little fella!
1455191422	Aren't you a skinny little one.
1192749352	Heh. Don't you bring bad luck?
2036143995	Ho! Hunting mice, I hope?
1468255639	Off you go then.
1034851657	Good huntin'.
1703248832	Cute little thing.
2464468	Go make yourself useful.
940704528	...Lord almighty!
2041903841	...Yes yes, very amusing!
1013885473	...I will report this!

2005188849	...
1355211765	...

803271171	Voices in my head...
1285987871	Secret whispers...
355544448	I listen... Must listen...
1945208992	I think... Mustn't think.
1996631365	Oooh, it's all fine...
1373923911	The path is clear...
1877798811	There is someone else...
2020855618	You say my name...
2143066449	Cannot think... 
1229474883	Fear...
157080375	Such fear...
1920479725	Help... 
1176032343	I need help...
1112030116	Someone... Anyone...
1789055741	Indeed...
8187974	On my way.
1927538475	Of course...
170354041	Oh yes.
1119862568	Certainly.
914398523	Yes.
1954559353	Yeees.
1162118041	I-I'll get to it.
1856470902	As you wish.
203133843	All right.
991019008	Uhh... How...
129189134	Where... How...
1108965329	I...don't know...
1489422814	No... No, no...
616050389	No... Can't see...
1370406774	Like this, yes?
20413260	I have this...
847288929	Yes, done...
2080120170	Just like this...
860538326	Oh no!
1229045994	Please no!
1591647283	Good lord!
759251794	Aaaah!
1362344387	Help! Help!
880638309	Somebody help!
1836810436	Help! Anybody!

779104460	W-wait, what happened?
971720853	Huh... It sure was strange...
1723270020	So...how did I get here?
402079180	Huh... What happened?
676940050	How can I help you miss?
1186460298	What can I do for you?
861102406	Certainly, how can I help?
1141318838	Why, hello there.
824800852	Anything you need, madam.
649410607	I think I have what you need.
714406862	I'm listening, I'm listening.
1011550010	I fully understand, madam.
1029697491	Whatever you say, madam.
2065720619	A pleasure talking to you.
371288205	See you again I hope.
423989109	Take care, madam.
176636953	Have a pleasant day, madam.
666116690	Vincent?
620177203	Ah, our illustrious host.
1773348926	Of course, Vincent.
1197346772	Good to see you, Vincent.
507457676	How interesting.
1835290209	The things you know.
252398187	Fascinating.
1044338628	Yes, you know best.
1958405657	Make sure and come by later.
1474295767	A pleasure as always.
2087685608	Don't be too busy, Vincent.
310626590	Thank God he's gone...
1099090327	Very well.
2132538844	Oh, certainly.
2013904438	I will follow.
1057247755	Lead the way, madam.
395322623	Lucky man.
1375284782	Well, look at you!
293810522	Lucky fellow.
999448240	Have fun now.
1600815268	I'm sorry, I have to get back.
1266441876	Apologies. I really shouldn't.
1683293557	I'll be heading back now.
698558229	What am I doing? Excuse me, madam.
2018920525	Another fruitful day...
1946790958	Let's see, what else...
868501497	No, this simply won't do...
449157758	Everything's in order.
1649367903	Huh... Never noticed that...
1696976979	Later... Yes, later.
35234754	This is getting tedious.
853477431	Definitely overpriced.
2048309713	Have to keep that in mind.
1925787763	Ah! I almost forgot...
551782307	...
779162421	...
346144018	...
1325920266	...
80684836	...
1765444109	...
1960673124	...
1776834948	...
752410349	...
338238124	...
1771978347	Cheers!
561917632	To good health!
1358512548	Hear hear!
341251143	Here's looking at you.
1550405496	Frank sure is in a good mood.
135172677	When do we ride?
289828826	Ghastly bandits...
1055765282	They will not take me!
101692663	Let's hope it stays quiet...
2095019238	It is getting late...
264744419	I can't wait for the ceremony.
121761797	Marvelous decor.
278616144	Our dear cousin, dead.
528434329	There's a killer on the loose.
1698083933	Blasted rain.
908925213	A sizeable ranch.
1682845406	Unacceptable. We'll miss the wedding!
1388102611	We have been here for days.
183748875	I will write a formal complaint.
1345528007	I'm freezing! This is outrageous.
1179213137	I'll keep watch.
510321581	Frank's showing a temper.
753986865	Awful noise last night.
298519570	Those blasted strangers.
978720618	We're in luck. Third catch this month.
1865469161	The girl will fetch a good price.
1164868044	Busy night in New Orleans.
1827810284	Love the city at night.
1707018182	I must get out of here.
291656638	This must be a mistake.
925432350	Ugh, I'm soaking.
91773672	What in God's name is going on...
1863627758	So tired.
1155449731	I need to lie down...
1328839800	What do Devitt's men want here?
428108320	I don't like their looks.
1404158269	Hot day in the desert. Well, what a surprise!
979643330	Spectacular evening.
440689633	Vincent has outdone himself.
263066241	This is the life.
598229842	Like the good old days.
992150743	How is your day?
1633163262	I can't complain.
886679303	Good day.
1921241005	Good day.
1281982779	How are you?
1861065265	I'm fine. How are you?
242895110	Anything amiss?
299927244	No, it's nothing.
1144484032	Excuse me, can I borrow some tobacco?
1899908885	Sorry, I can't help you.
1823444269	Are you up for drinks later?
1046850752	Certainly.
2039032965	Any trouble?
1155899149	Thankfully not.
392767446	Would you like a game of chess later?
1894128848	You need to ask?
336283792	How did it go?
656757670	No trouble at all.
2141343149	When do we ride?
797191852	I'm not sure. Soon.
825296021	Hey, where is the whiskey?
1441173104	Ran dry yesterday.
1788417218	You think help is coming?
1593204090	We'll have to wait and see.
1545312537	I despise bandits.
1966318731	That makes two of us.
1924533883	Are the company men making trouble?
106819391	Not more than usual.
387042911	You okay, friend?
432249676	Don't worry. I'll manage.
880184337	I'm so excited for him.
430716708	Our dear cousin, finally married.
1623845207	Did you see the bride's dress?
638272093	Oh yes. Only the best for our cousin.
28312915	Did you see what happened?
364435049	I'd like to. Is there a body.
502620253	So much for our dear cousin.
919148463	I never liked him anyway.
329525106	This is a sizeable ranch.
1935406511	Ostentatious!
1181197334	Must it rain?
918047347	Come now, you're not made of straw.
1370785083	It's freezing!
20526168	I'm going to catch something nasty.
804123044	Did you hear the news about Flagstone?
1845102299	So what? We're missing the wedding!
167532865	Do we think he was alone?
289527255	It's unclear.
1403172243	Did you see the man?
220568750	Indeed. A big bounty hunter.
1345606494	Any ideas about what's going on?
1690547777	My money is on swamp witches.
911229729	You think it is true? The devil himself?
1857900652	I'd rather not think about that.
1415285010	I wouldn't mind a tumble with the girl.
1927048387	You'll be a eunuch by the morrow, sir!
1117004043	What is taking so long?
814439946	We have a few stragglers.
154845371	Lovely night, isn't it.
1840490217	Most certainly.
450269820	Did you hear who's coming?
1673988065	I did. It'll be a show.
1827375073	We have to get out of here.
1836878704	Best we bide our time.
1313872944	How do we get out?
1497610560	Patience.
660665663	Did you see the ship that came in?
381532331	It belongs to the DeVitt Company.
1392186670	Why would they block the roads?
1979457134	Company business, most likely.
800313501	I can hardly stand.
652077283	You and me both, friend.
1458576926	I can't take this anymore.
255570458	Stay strong, friend.
2123945253	What are they doing here?
582440856	There was a breakout at the mine.
1408426731	They seem on edge.
527110651	They are hunting dangerous men.
16734669	Enjoy the evening so far?
1075702507	How can I not?
557500789	Vincent seems a little on edge.
2116629180	Oh, you're imagining things.
1460636674	You think they will come?
771560481	I trust Frank's instinct.
734432421	Reminds me of the good old days.
1157808654	Same heat.
1572279586	I'm telling you, it won't end well.
1989904175	Yes, I've heard about that.
1396983383	You should leave it to the professionals.
714515511	That is exactly what I'm talking about.
748288545	Don't tell anyone, understand?
1461604777	What about the other one?
956050062	It won't matter in the long run.
749566989	Just listen for a moment.
1137319370	Very well, but what happens now?
1977448926	Don't worry. I have seen it before.
1456092132	I'm not sure I follow.
1433259634	I can't believe I missed that.
1928335019	That is the difference right there.
332311510	I told you so, didn't I?
273855757	That cannot be true, can it?
1293702965	You best believe it.
1315036200	Certainly that's nothing new.
832668214	One does hear all kinds of things.
430207378	I feel that times are changing.
1557878430	That is news to me.
425294411	Now, where was I?
1903320517	Lost my thought... Ah, yes.
1330282399	As I was saying...
2030500107	Right, where were we...
142550144	Let's get back to the point...
743921636	Stop it! That's not right!
1943237329	What are you doing there?
1546479548	Would you please stop that!
360388241	I see what you are up to.
1801404900	You are a strange fellow.
1385037847	Are you being weird on purpose?
648607637	What are you doing here?
725254074	You really shouldn't be here!
1633256433	You better not let the guards see you!
1494333216	...
1726812418	...
1027449525	...
513141098	...
1796421953	...
354432373	...
1985450551	Help! Guards!
832375262	Sweet Jesus no!
428750482	Oh God!
1781917093	Aaaaah!
2081467471	Help! Help!
1487347264	Somebody help!
1922207065	Anyone! Help!
1856991275	I have to get away!
794448066	I cannot stay here!
447958076	Quickly!
354452970	Don't move a muscle.
2026520431	Why does this keep happening?
1616624561	This is rather unfortunate.
960396620	I must take shelter.

685085022	...
1492791628	...
1977122599	She's expired!
128008751	Sweet lord! She's dead!
972866228	He's expired.
1553938138	Sweet lord! He's dead!
2063510535	A corpse! Good lord!
7700022	Murdered in cold blood!
827287725	He was slain by one of his own.
2035357434	A fellow guard took his life.
884070965	She was murdered by one of her own.
425422005	A fellow guard took her life.
1291237333	Slain by a fellow guard. Barbaric, but wonderful.
1777785314	Dead. One of his comrade's handiwork.
812978466	Sweet Jesus!
2094808936	Is this a practical joke?
1829555398	Good lord!
644965549	Foreign tracks. Who's been through here?
908112359	I don't recall seeing these footprints.
675612776	Who left this ominous trail behind?
391374408	Footprints. Could be anyone's.
458222763	Damnation. The light went out.
1517282018	Again with the light? Imbeciles.
1435054585	A gentlewoman always carries matches.
880006116	Come now. Again with the light?
1942381254	W-what in God's name?!
65760699	Ah! What struck him down?
1741304659	Good lord! Witchcraft!
1676427167	You're possessed by demons!
2116265120	Stop! How could you?!
1673708058	Stop! No! I forbid it!
1998640128	It certainly looks valuable.
2023984935	Who'd leave such a thing here?
1488625478	I don't recall seeing this before.
377856755	A shame to leave that there.
2085533696	You have a new owner, my dear.
871547310	I'm going to stake my claim.
1219092513	I think a few drinks at the club are in order.
458272752	How fortunate.
1887840508	Fortune favors me today.
325950317	Is she asleep?
764707868	What is she doing?
1145154622	Is he asleep?
1319959369	What is he doing?
190516649	Hey! What's with you?
422305852	Lazing about, are we?
74442528	Someone's tied her up!
83293604	Someone's violated her!
986101809	Someone's tied him up!
837170238	Someone's overwhelmed him!
896525521	Someone's tied you up good!
1887530676	Who put you in this sorry state?
980992627	Where is she?
309837379	Where has she gone?
574308779	I'm sure she was here before.
1370923203	Where is he?
275099562	Where did he go?
667692644	I know he was here before.
1499447213	It seems I'm missing a partner.
506781908	I'm kept waiting, apparently.
1335797698	Hey! What's keeping you?
1250701930	Come now, friend. Wake up.
1962324965	Hey! Wake up, will you?
882731690	Are you all right?
909655195	What fiend did this to you?
1400102306	Let me take care of your bonds.
2119623311	Hmm, what?
990007802	What a peculiar noise.
1135141105	What was that?
1144564863	Come out, whoever is doing this!
342575783	Yes, yes, very entertaining!
1452079675	That is quite enough!
1353881883	Where did that come from?!
1723975177	Gunfire! Good lord!
1834113627	They are armed and hostile.
297674054	I could have sworn...
1618435563	I heard you! Come out!
133604209	Is anyone there?
1203819468	Enough already!
570792970	I bid you to stop that.
642610030	Stop this nonsense.
790925529	The hell was that?
672651697	Am I going crazy?
1959932993	Ah! Uh...what?
1563100458	What am I doing?
1033223694	Never mind.
1843686868	This is stupid.
407298079	What is going on here?
2025874676	Is anyone here?
1776850797	Anyone? Show yourself!
193502756	This jest has had its course.
2030010949	I am not in the mood for games.
1683356848	Nothing. Oh well.
1778758163	Nothing to be done here.
978722772	Gone. Back to it then.
1481694638	I have better things to do.
2089207196	This was a waste of time.
635231769	I'm not going to walk there.
1775870923	I'm disinclined to walk there.
923547475	That's too far off.
2042168394	I am not heading inside.
336838128	I'd rather stay outside.
362466324	I cannot go in there right now.
1357363166	I am not heading outside.
945408639	I'd rather stay inside.
883959084	I cannot go outside right now.
881969723	There is no way to get there.
39400020	That is far too much trouble.
1999722965	Over there? Hah, you jest.
1176534400	They wandered off, most likely.
580288198	Maybe they had to relieve themselves.
1340714392	Stood up again.
1309355379	There you are! I was worried sick!
255874644	Why would you wander off like that?
951825582	Good lord! You put the scare in me!
1622624274	Oh my! What happened?
1188693423	Damnation.
1134504867	This is horrible.
2115236093	This can't be happening.
1941204400	Lord almighty.
1573683953	Horrible. Just horrible.
40003383	Tragic. Most tragic.
1211247312	I will have nightmares from this.
1649813276	Nothing to be done about it.

2016920179	Uhm...
604391259	One moment...
442451549	What is that?
1156968898	Something...
783676270	What on earth...
2142854785	Strange...
543018049	Curious...
957078014	Hey now...
1556099877	Is that...?
1654355238	What...?
1819593496	Hmm...
125970734	Uhhh...
1301390310	Hey there, little guy!
335372129	Aren't you a strange one.
840192193	Heh. Don't you bring bad luck?
163718385	Ho! Hunting mice, I hope?
65723539	Off you go then.
1243751171	Good huntin'.
1143506614	Cute little thing.
1384837613	Go make yourself useful.
639264608	...Lord almighty!
840688859	...Yes yes, very amusing!
1379504118	...I will report this!

1596448609	I listen... Must listen...
1921943326	I think... Mustn't think.
613944237	Oooh, it's all fine...
1111152083	The path is clear...
1817618658	There is someone else...
324524858	You say my name...
1428800614	Cannot think... 
495240633	Fear...
1606238999	Such fear...
1158415786	Help... 
2023301664	I need help...
200764158	Someone... anyone...
1946915193	Indeed...
2127052066	On my way.
751372532	Of course...
1537473366	Oh yes.
936072684	Certainly.
785471103	Yes.
467392789	Yeees.
762342338	I-I'll get to it.
1224415745	As you wish.
175433459	All right.
1631634102	Uhh... How...?
61222040	Where... How...?
1268221957	I...don't know...
1288435202	No... No, no...
705637326	No... Can't see...
2125765750	Like this, yes?
2065347576	I have this...
1646844260	Yes, done...
1681595034	Just like this...
1597351080	Oh no!
1967046888	Please no!
503664669	Good lord!
1615276102	Aaaah!
938108615	Help! Help!
1080758150	Somebody help!
1469594946	Help! Anybody!
1999763462	...
1281508472	...
1039779411	...
189213176	...
1271225798	W-wait, what happened?
714701772	Huh... It was strange...
1428535420	So...how did I get here?
975495802	Huh... What happened?
511318392	Anything I can help with?
2107766117	My, this will be interesting.
112519650	And who are you, madam?
1005170768	Yes? Do I know you?
1469219878	My, you're a naughty girl.
1425080148	You're definitely a looker.
1346624600	What are you suggesting?
754004383	Mhm, I'm listening.
682724068	The pleasure was all mine.
1614927031	Yes. See you later, perhaps.
1381527384	Take care, madam.
1181088113	Have a pleasant day.
354589831	Vincent?
324802145	Ah, our illustrious host.
421176680	Of course, Vincent.
190611881	Good to see you, Vincent.
1023305032	How interesting.
226379297	The things you know.
1456522951	Fascinating.
1593169969	Yes, you know best.
1933670674	Make sure and come by later.
495737185	A pleasure as always.
520674673	Don't be too busy, Vincent.
1792018848	Thank God he's gone...
57814753	Perhaps another time.
300023923	You overestimate yourself, my dear.
157253991	That won't happen, madam.
1205381688	That is going too far.
1455994893	You lucky bastard.
1799624607	She's too good for ya!
1136043908	Yeah, yeah. You go have fun...
1622906240	Oh, darlin'. He's not worth the trouble, believe me.
1876460036	Oh no you don't.
1159306835	She's just playing with ya.
1554178564	Don't let her fool you.
134363889	Another fruitful day...
905640874	Let's see, what else...
667315518	No, this simply won't do...
374669181	Everything's in order.
641843691	Huh... Never noticed that...
453225355	Later... Yes, later.
1577539249	This is getting tedious.
1852398044	Definitely overpriced.
1961188689	Have to keep that in mind.
1017343242	Ah! I almost forgot...
940229683	...
1925386742	...
1340397718	...
701621120	...
609277026	...
1704211417	...
353465689	...
2071555800	...
1653360674	...
636145960	...
30709434	Cheers!
1658540811	To good health!
1470790383	Hear hear!
967610991	Here's looking at you.
782589311	Frank sure is in a good mood.
57085310	When do we ride?
1688770861	Ghastly bandits...
659892002	They will not take me!
1236935	Let's hope it stays quiet...
795989707	It is getting late...
1782436612	I can't wait for the ceremony.
1550155774	Marvelous decor.
182336083	Our dear cousin, dead.
1918570456	There's a killer on the loose.
638228143	Blasted rain.
295492585	A sizeable ranch.
1324786057	Unacceptable. We'll miss the wedding!
1951713450	We have been here for days.
261253294	I will write a formal complaint.
280742776	I'm freezing! This is outrageous.
1068511834	I will keep watch.
2067887538	Frank is showing a temper.
410397557	Awful noise last night.
1229775573	Those blasted strangers.
1786729789	We're in luck. Third catch this month.
658494238	The girl will fetch a good price.
1290257057	Busy night in New Orleans.
1184606581	Love the city at night.
1097770410	I must get out of here.
1160507109	This is a mistake.
2127308551	Ugh, I'm soaking.
1181972112	What in God's name is going on...
1207670221	So tired.
140417925	I need to lie down...
2052132623	What do company men want here?
734917050	I don't like their looks.
186294582	Hot day in the desert.
1007284668	Spectacular evening.
730209391	Vincent has outdone himself.
1760518251	This is the life.
907284283	Like the good old days.
1954457527	How is your day?
429279556	I can't complain.
403000237	Good day.
1846004557	Good day.
7733384	How are you?
1535306321	I'm fine. How are you?
923335378	Anything amiss?
561936083	Oh, it's nothing.
1598338893	Excuse me, can I borrow some tobacco?
1042228625	Sorry, I can't help you.
998181370	Are you up for drinks later?
1949789269	Certainly.
1554566593	Any trouble?
210397664	Thankfully not.
1695715331	You up for a game of poker later?
1892589894	You need to ask?
576168993	How did it go?
2147364375	It was a cinch.
1220917553	When do we ride?
843663462	I'm not sure. Soon.
659402639	Hey, where is the whiskey?
506731499	We ran dry yesterday.
2087867666	You think help is coming?
491522944	We'll have to wait and see.
991875847	I despise bandits.
945648983	That makes two of us.
770265890	Are the company men making trouble?
1059918480	Not more than usual.
1119741147	You okay, friend?
2005417954	Don't worry. I'll manage.
1530696088	I'm so excited for him.
1896159954	Our dear cousin, finally married.
2138345405	Did you see the bride's dress?
395131905	Oh yes. Only the best for our cousin.
1255898381	Did you see what happened?
537931171	I'd like to. Is there a body?
1094849248	So much for our dear cousin.
561802132	I never liked him anyway.
271065096	This is a sizeable ranch.
122050469	I have seen bigger.
1779884202	Must it rain tonight?
277975513	Come now, you're not made of straw.
1330214847	It's freezing!
1804844047	I'm going to catch something nasty.
1680920523	Did you hear the news about Flagstone?
1068000334	So what? We're missing the wedding!
944483258	Do we think he was alone?
1766129879	It's unclear. Stay sharp.
1854907898	Did you see the man?
876676388	Indeed. A damn bounty hunter.
742465346	Any clues on what's going on?
1130272016	My money is on swamp witches.
2105042420	You think it is true? The devil himself?
845140358	I'd rather not think about it.
855641018	I wouldn't mind a tumble with the girl.
2038972020	The boss won't like that.
1791990369	What is taking so long?
1904951934	We still have a few stragglers.
1727604312	Lovely night, isn't it.
1441520069	Most certainly.
102311604	Did you hear who's coming?
1005990359	I did. It'll be a show.
1778946503	We have to break out of here.
1200978396	Best we bide our time.
232424106	How do we get out?
1238309353	Patience.
743014583	Did you see the ship that came in?
1534779148	It belongs to DeVitt.
1299584755	Why would they block the roads?
1240713191	Company business, most likely.
901565422	I can hardly stand.
1418076256	You and me both, friend.
620911853	I can't take this anymore.
867395614	Stay strong, friend.
1881750636	What are they doing here?
1284010605	There was a breakout at the mine.
148687909	They seem on edge.
1616648104	They are hunting dangerous men.
1144457094	Enjoy the evening so far?
1196313950	How can I not?
1587676867	Vincent seems a little on edge.
1643949158	Oh, you're imagining things.
806214391	You think they will come?
1293344806	I trust Frank's instinct.
515854775	Reminds me of the good old days.
2098670320	Same old heat also.
1765507380	I'm telling you, it won't end well.
562162167	Yes, I've heard about that.
1073260008	You should leave it to the professionals.
2054331313	That is exactly what I'm talking about.
84928980	Don't tell anyone, understand?
1965305206	What about the other one?
252449846	It won't matter in the long run.
1001318888	Just listen for a moment.
993942892	Very well, but what happens now?
1899894936	Don't worry. I have seen it before.
448934298	I'm not sure I follow.
1236928875	I can't believe I missed that.
1477876591	That is the difference right there.
1817297803	I told you so, didn't I?
936941692	That cannot be true, can it?
1673973709	You best believe it.
1261649749	Certainly that's nothing new.
1195829652	One does hear all kinds of things lately.
639909000	I feel that times are changing.
1834783339	That is news to me.
2018335622	Now, where was I?
1166500983	Lost my thought... Ah, yes.
1465055266	As I was saying...
985567019	Right, where were we...
462550873	Back to the point...
860014485	Stop it! That's not right!
1904139271	What are you doing there?
1130226246	Would you please stop that!
1060555275	I see what you are up to.
211896578	You are a strange fellow.
836339868	Are you being weird on purpose?
14948735	What are you doing here?
528246676	You really should not be here.
1982206999	You better not let the guards see you!
1389033116	...
1430088976	...
1646123408	...
1390038058	...
1909370950	...

1809394359	Não mate ninguém.
1318402913	Isso não vai funcionar.
1479660222	Isso parece suicídio.
1680928210	Vamos tentar passar despercebidos. Prefiro evitar problemas desnecessários.
1334023768	Cuidado agora.
860201247	Oh, cale a boca McCoy.

1063320780	Parar no meio do caminho
1755510902	Pressione <hotkey>{0}</hotkey> para parar no meio de escadas, cordas e trepadeiras.
1836583362	Movendo corpos no modo Duelo
68164799	Se você pegar um corpo no modo Duelo, poderá reservar uma ação adicional para movê-lo e largá-lo. Isso também funciona ao Matar e Mover.
240081232	Pontos intermediários no modo Duelo
321945412	No modo Duelo, você pode traçar um único ponto para cada personagem.
1843019443	Informações de Reforço
72136199	Pressione <hotkey>{0}</hotkey> ou passe o mouse sobre o ícone de um quartel para ver o número e o tipo de reforços que serão implantados durante um alarme, bem como o número total de reservas.
1133491710	Segure <hotkey>{1}</hotkey> e pressione <hotkey>{0}</hotkey> ou mova o cursor sobre o ícone de um quartel para ver o número e o tipo de reforços que serão implantados durante um alarme, bem como o número total de reservas.
1806446353	Limites de reforço
2073461372	A cada novo alarme, guardas mortos ou amarrados serão substituídos pelas reservas limitadas da Casa da Guarda. Se uma Casa da Guarda estiver vazia, não haverá mais reforços.
1306284367	Cães latindo
1729303052	Um cachorro latindo não dispara o alarme, mas os guardas que o ouvem virão investigar.
1491777208	Estados atordoado
1324369933	Se um guarda encontrar um outro atordoado, ele o acordará e não tocará o alarme. No entanto, se testemunharem o nocaute ou encontrarem a vítima amarrada, eles irão acionar o alarme.
242717582	Isca casacos longos
841587656	Os casacos longos são imunes às iscas, mas você ainda pode atraí-los com pegadas ou lâmpadas apagadas.
230296262	Tiros como isca
1005629954	Se você se sente ousado, pode usar o ruído dos seus tiros como isca. Isso dispara o alarme, mas pode atrair grandes grupos de inimigos, incluindo Casacos Longos, para um local de sua escolha.
2134260994	Mente que controla casacos longos
705025876	Os casacos longos são resistentes ao controle mental de Isabelle. Eles só podem ser controlados enquanto estão atordoados.
656581142	Mentes Controladas
1599654236	Ao realizar uma matança com um guarda controlado pela mente, o marcará como um culpado. Se outros guardas testemunharem o assassinato, eles atacarão o culpado. Se eles encontrarem o culpado inconsciente perto da vítima, eles o amarrarão.
97437742	Culpados e Casacos Longos
335053795	Se um Casaco Longo for atordoado por um guarda controlado pela mente, ele lembrará do rosto do culpado e o matará na próxima vez que o vir.
1258883271	Habilidade de Controle mental
1486407837	As habilidades disponíveis durante o controle da mente dependem da vítima. Os guardas podem executar uma matança com suas respectivas armas. Os civis podem pedir ajuda para atrair guardas.
1289329808	Conexão e distrações
759975619	Se dois guardas estiverem conectados e um deles ouvir um ruído perturbador (como a moeda de Cooper), ambos olharão na direção do ruído.
2003290337	Conexão e iscas
241375047	Se dois guardas estiverem conectados e um deles for atraído por uma isca (como a bolsa de McCoy), outros também darão alguns passos em direção à isca e depois pensam melhor e retornam aos seus postos.
1911833233	Conexão e tipos de danos
477939682	A conexão sempre transfere o mesmo tipo de dano. Mate um guarda e seu colega conectado morrerá. Bata e o outro ficará inconsciente.
400560812	Conexão e casacos longos
1973720970	Casacos longos podem ficar atordoados com os danos recebidos pelos guardas conectados. O efeito será sempre um atordoamento, mesmo que o tipo de dano normalmente os mate (como o machado de Hector).
696649581	Habilidades de conexão e cegar
137918846	Se dois guardas estiverem conectados e um deles ficar cego (ou seja, pelo perfume de Kate), os dois guardas ficarão cegos.
331045493	Movimento da gata
753041168	O gato de Isabelle pode subir escadas, cordas e trepadeiras. Mas não pode nadar.
2127142431	Roubar
602778606	Se um guarda estiver carregando um item importante, Kate poderá rouba-lo de seus bolsos.
801171987	Águas Rasas e Corpos
735202007	Água rasa pode ser usada para esconder cadáveres.
1288975608	Acender Tochas
127998834	Você pode acender uma tocha em todos os incêndios pelo jogo, incluindo outras tochas.
139855627	Tochas e arbustos
1348930656	Agachar-se dentro de um arbusto extinguirá sua tocha.
328319678	Cadáveres pelo jogo
2026724582	Você pode usar cadáveres que matou como isca sem causar alarme.
1591065676	Arremesso de corpos
301069101	Se você atirar um corpo em outro guarda, eles serão nocauteados. Um arremesso não pode derrubar vários guardas.

859114774	Os desafios do barão
1049284093	Sussurros no escuro
502931271	O Barão espera nas sombras. Ele entrará em contato com você quando for a hora certa.
2141318135	O Barão Toma Nota
1197034691	Você é contatado por um homem misterioso que se faz conhecido por você como o Barão. Suas ações atraíram o interesse de seus clientes e ele oferece a você a chance de participar de desafios exclusivos para o benefício do entretenimento deles. O Barão colocará à prova sua habilidade no jogo e, às vezes, ajustará a mecânica estabelecida de maneiras inesperadas.
1313161225	Novo desafio
35945019	O Barão tem um novo desafio para você.
659216221	Lei de Fuga
309882009	A sealed letter is pushed under the door to your room at the saloon. You pick it up, recognizing the Baron's seal on the wax./n/n"How long has it been since Flagstone, friend? You'd be surprised how little has changed. Why don't you come visit? A new challenge awaits."/n/nYou ask around who delivered the letter, but nobody saw anyone.
370901028	The Baron has beckoned you to Flagstone to tackle his latest challenge. He has tasked you with eliminating a certain snakeoil salesman, who is peddling his wares at the heart of town, and delivering his body to the open grave at the church.
1447220327	Hazards of the Trade
1794102132	A courier wordlessly passes you by, quickly putting a slightly crumpled note into your hands, penned in the Baron's handwriting./n/n"I hear your last visit to O'Hara Ranch was quite spectacular. A new challenge awaits you there, if you're interested."/n/nYou turn around to grab hold of the courier, but the man has already vanished in the crowd.
1275070322	You have returned to O'Hara Ranch for the Baron's latest challenge. Your task is to kill all targets without using any of your weapons. Instead, you must use the environment to dispose of them.
1120194126	Three Men With No Name
2002330802	A coach window opens next to you. A gloved hand emerges and gives you a postcard. It is signed by the Baron./n/n "Greetings from Baton Rouge, friend! The locals here tell me all kinds of things about you. Why don't you join me here for a drink? I've already come up with a new challenge."/n/nBefore you can ask any questions, the window closes and the coach drives off, soon disappearing around the next corner.
251713547	You have taken a trip to Baton Rouge, where another of the Baron's challenges awaits you. He wants you to deliver the bodies of three targets to the coffins inside the bank. However, you don't know where they are, only that they look exactly like a certain someone.
724854570	Bear Trap Triplets
2094260086	Walking along the river shore, you stumble over an old whiskey bottle half buried in the sand. Inside you find a wet piece of paper, marked with the Baron's seal./n/n "You can find many things on the banks of the Mississippi, friend. Slavers, ambushes, new allies... How about this time, I make it a new challenge for you?"/n/nYou look around for someone who could have planted the bottle, but there is no one in sight.
1982537406	Once again, you find yourself in the wilderness along the banks of the Mississippi. In his latest challenge, the Baron has provided two additional bear traps for Hector, and tasked you to kill a group of targets with them.
343104554	Best Served Cold
478081862	You have barely finished your meal when the waiter brings you the check and leaves. You open the leather folder, only to discover the Baron's seal embossed on the inside, paired with a letter./n/n"I hope you enjoy the local cuisine, friend. New Orleans has many different flavors to discover. How about a little challenge after a hearty meal? Don't worry, the food is on the house."/n/nYou wait a long time for the waiter to return, but he never shows up again.
1933087629	Your long awaited visit to New Orleans is interrupted when the Baron arrives with a new challenge for you. He wants you to extract an old associate of his from the busy market and deliver him, dead or alive, to the Baron's private steamboat at Pier 9.

1206716644	Let's do it!
1579715971	Reconstructing Your Savegame
641641696	Here's the deal. Everyone you killed or tied up in your old save is up and running again. We can't have that, can we? That's why they all now have a special mark of death. Spooky, right?/nSo what you can do now is click on them and let hellfire rain down on their heads. Sound fun? That's because it is! If you wanna see them bite the dust all at once, just select "Call the Undertaker!", and we're gonna do the rest./nOh, and don't worry about mission objectives or whether your gang is safe. We already took care of that stuff.

1340780470	NEW ORLEANS – DEVITT COMPANY LOCKDOWN
1931549038	A smell of seaweed surrounds the bloated corpse. As you search his pockets, you find a small figurine. A disturbing display of a foreign creatue, tentacles surrounding its gaping mouth. 
884720503	Something unexplainable has happened in New Orleans tonight. Three murders were commited, all exactly when the clock struck 6.
9708345	The first victim: A captain who wanted to escape his fate. His rusty vessel the only thing that kept him afloat. Beneath him, the blackness of the river. And inside him an even darker blackness. 
1450293716	It is done. The butcher lies dead before you, the eldritch flame inside him extinguished. His soul is beyond redemption, but New Orleans has weathered the storm... for now. Good work.
526570151	Investigate Crime Scenes

577617173	The Depths
382025701	A captain who wanted to escape his fate. His rusty vessel the only thing that kept him afloat. Beneath him, the blackness of the river. And inside him an even darker blackness. 
601936825	The Loner
254541811	A lonely person met a lonely death. Surrounded by his only friends, cackling, picking litter from the floor, picking blood from his veins, picking meat from his innards.
1184941873	Amongst Pigs
963001693	An honorable man, slaughtered and left amongst the filthiest. An unjust end, for he gave hope and comfort to those who needed it the most.
1209259200	The Metal Badge
825897588	A small metal badge found on the body. It reads "Florence Smolker's Oriental Spices".
1740598686	The Body
1325527419	There is something wrong with that persons corpse. A little shine, only visible if seen in the furtherst corner of the eye. It draws you to it. Hard to resist.
1163939158	The Chickens
1200022366	The chickens are picking away at the rotting body in the corner. You get the feeling that something is calling to you. From... inside the chickens. It's voice growing more intense by the second. Until it is an unbearable scream inside of your head.
1879106691	The sweet stench of decay invades your nostrils. As you examine the pig's body you see something in the corner of your eye. A glittering object hidden in the pockets of the human corpse next to it. 
707546696	As you pick up the body, a tiny metal badge drops to the floor. It reads "Florence Smolker's Oriental Spices".
115228868	The sweet stench of decay invades your nostrils. You examine the pig's body but find nothing. The badge in your pocket seems to be pulsating, like it wants to tell you "Ignore those filthy bodies. FIND. THE. LOCK."
1262534177	As you go through the corpse's pockets, the cackle of the chickens seems to get louder and louder. You see them occasionally picking into the corpse's open wound, devouring it's flesh. 
2036902556	As you cut open the chicken, you find a small coin. It is covered in blood and guts, but seems to be glowing like a radiant miniature sun. You can almost feel it buzzing in your hand. 
772586931	As you enter the store, the revitalizing smell of different spices quickly gets to your head. You instantly know where to look. You open a small cupboard in the darkest corner of the room.
1232845740	As you put the third artifact into your pocket, a creeping chill crawls over your spine. Your sight starts to get blurry as you fight to keep your balance. Something in New Orleans has... changed. 
1103300527	The next day – Bayous of New Orleans, Louisiana
2086026573	You did it!
114163874	DEVITT GOLDMINE – SOMEWHERE IN NEW MEXICO

1872830447	Later that day – Eagle Falls Bridge, Colorado
665079477	Nicely done. All ready and safe for transport. I knew I could count on your discretion.
1462795072	Running your fingers over the figurine's smooth, pitchblack surface, you feel like you are slowly starting to slip...  You  quickly hide it in one of your pockets.
2042798963	You put the badge in your pocket. Shortly after, it starts pulsating, like it wants to tell you "Ignore those filthy bodies. FIND. THE. LOCK."
138387610	You realize that something inside one of the chickens is calling to you. An uncanny whisper that grows inside your head. "Let me out."
653215157	As you wipe the blood off of it, the buzzing stops. It's just a dull, rusty coin now. You put it into your pocket.
412945230	Inside you find a tiny horn with neatly executed carvings on it. You cannot decipher their meaning. Quickly, you put the horn into your pocket.
1466539405	You can feel the presence of the killer. It is time to avenge the dead or get torn to pieces yourself.
2076581508	The second victim: A lonely person, meeting a lonely death. Surrounded by his only friends, cackling, picking litter from the floor, picking blood from his veins, picking meat from his innards.
1520042128	The third victim: An honorable man, slaughtered and left among the filth. An unjust end, for he gave hope and comfort to those who needed it most.

1809509597	Do you think you're ready?
941798258	Let's take a trip down memory lane. Ask ourselves "what if?". One last visit to Devil's Canyon. One more shot at redemption.
1265043144	This time, two mismatched figures approach. One is the kid, knives in hand. The other is the trapper, eyes watchful.
1996320184	They've come here for the same reason they all come. The man they call Frank. He's waiting at the chapel. Not much farther to go.
2143700932	And just like that, it's over. The man they call Frank lies dead in the sand. The kid stands triumphant, his father avenged.
1393836394	McCoy

246912015	Evening of the same day – Outskirts of Las Piedras, New Mexico

209249049	It appears Miss O'Hara has been trapped at the altar again. The ceremony is well on its way. Once the priest arrives, her fate is sealed.
2023952286	There goes the servant to let the priest in.
1832990057	Take her out before she reaches the gate, or you will lose before you can even start.
198341473	Once she is out of the picture, you will have time for a little more... mischief.

69930805	You pick up the piece of paper. It's not a letter, but a small drawing. A coin, an uncanny figurine and a small horn. They form a triangle. In it's center, a haunting depicition of a demonic figure. It's eyes seem to pierce right into your soul.
203047558	Suddenly, you hear the crashing waves of the harbor again. You don't know how long you were staring at the drawing. Disgusted, you tear it apart and throw away the pieces. The only thing left is a sickening feeling deep in your stomach. Whatever is going on here, you have to put an end to it.
1137129970	Maybe after this he will finally show us some gratitude.

1656235817	That's one for the mantlepiece.

1937238544	Let's test how free of sin this priest really is.
987448738	Anyway, your targets today will be three simple men. Siblings, in fact. One might even say they look exactly alike.
638189593	My clients want you to bring them to the bank and put them inside the coffins. The catch is, you'll have to find them first.
1719544610	Take a good look at this man. His clothes, his hair, his skin. He looks exactly like your targets. Use this to find your targets.
851475634	My clients are watching. Give them a show.
20331815	Deliver judgement from above. My clients are watching.
468356500	They push on through. Goings are hard. Franks men are many, and there's only two of them.
1500960987	The trapper looks at the kid, the knives in his hands. He has seen the kid throw those knifes a thousand times. The kid doesn't miss anymore.
660965238	The trapper keeps his weapon ready. He's watched the kid get crushed once. He won't let it happen again.
286197728	They've made it halfway to the chapel. Still a ways to go. How many has the kid killed already? He tries not to think about it.
2014509736	The kid acts like nothing's up, but his knees are weak. What if he's not ready this time? He pushes on regardless.
1647658802	The kid looks down at his hands. They have been washed clean with blood. At least his heart is at peace, or so he hopes.
1714075236	Maybe it would have been better that way. But reality has a habit of taking its time. We both know that's not how the story goes. A childs dream will always remain a fantasy.
329926232	This was a rare treat. Thank you for indulging me. I think this concludes our business, for the time being.

We are counting on your expertise."/n/nHis eyes are impossibly bright. You try to meet them, and you manage for a few brief seconds, but then you look away.

977386753	You have ridden through the desert for days. Your clothes are dusty, your stomach growling. The cook at the post station serves you a large plate of beans and bread. A letter comes with it, bearing the Baron's seal./n/n "You've made quite the journey, friend. Glad to see you here in one piece. How about a little diversion while you're here. Just some harmless fun. I think you've earned it."/n/nWhen you ask the cook who brought this letter, he just gives you a grumpy laugh before leaving you to your beans.
535138508	The Baron has sent you back to DeVitt's gold mine for his latest challenge. A special device has been prepared for you, a minecart that can turn into a Gatling gun. Perplexing surely, but that has never stopped the Baron. He tasked you to clear the map of enemies. Should be fun, yes?
171688385	For a Few Bullets More
658505006	You walk through a graveyard in the middle of nowhere. Smoke from your cigarette is carried away by the prairie wind. One of the graves lies open, a letter waiting for you in the coffin./n/n"Fancy meeting you here, friend. Taking some time to reminisce? How about a little challenge while you're at it. Let's find out what kind of person you are."/n/nYou look up from the writing and read the name on the gravestone. Unsurprisingly, it is your own. You smile, put out your cigarette on the tombstone and throw the butt into the open coffin.
1844062476	In this world, there's only two kinds of people my friend: Those with loaded guns and those who dig. Let's see what kind you belong to. Kill everyone on the map.
1857287282	Bird Hunting
1778221076	Doc McCoy is sitting in a private room at the local saloon. He has taken apart his Buntline, inspecting and cleaning every piece, a grim smile of satisfaction on his face./n/nMcCoy reaches down into his bag to retrieve an oil cloth. His hands brush against something that should not be there. A letter. He slowly picks it up, expects it from each side, then opens it with a scalpel./n/n"A new contract has come in. Details are enclosed within the envelope. My clients expect nothing but quality, Mr. McCoy. Impress them, and I will consider part of your debts repaid."/n/nMcCoy reads the letter carefully, then burns it at a nearby candle. As it burns, he reassembles his gun with quick, well-practiced movements. He is out the door before the ashes have cooled. 
326727781	You have returned to Casa DeVitt, where Doc McCoy must complete a personal contract for the Baron. Stationed on the roof of the mansion, he must eliminate a number of targets with his Buntline without triggering the alarm. Kate and Hector are there to assist him on the ground.
395418561	What If?
603403823	A red coach halts next to you. The door swings open silently. Thick lamplight and cushioned seats await you inside. As you climb in, you are overcome with a profound sense of déjà vu./n/nThe Baron greets you with a pleasant smile. His clothes are expensive as usual, the colors outrageously bright against the darkness of his skin. His teeth are ivory. His eyes twinkling with... something entirely different./n/n"You have proven yourself a man of many talents, my friend. My clients are very pleased. In fact, you might have become their new favorite. But that is not why I'm here today."/n/n"Today, we will just talk. Call it... indulging my curiosity." He looks at you with those twinkling eyes, and you feel yourself slipping. He smiles. "Shall we begin?"
